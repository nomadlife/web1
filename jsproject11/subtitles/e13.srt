1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,060
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,490
Phil Coulson is dying.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,440
Can we cure this?

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,770
The tissue is already dead.

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,200
There is no cure for that.

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,750
Ruby, when they resurface, I'll put an end to all of this.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,240
This entire S.H.I.E.L.D. chapter will be over.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,930
Your work is incomplete,

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,830
At least the beacon will do what it's supposed to do.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,740
I think that ?when the monoliths exploded,

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,730
they tore open a fear dimension.

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,390
And I was hoping ?there was enough Gravitonium

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,890
to stitch together the tear in space-time.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,050
Deke Shaw could possibly be an LMD.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,530
I ran a genetic profile to see if he was

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,010
biologically linked to anyone.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,500
And it came up with a match?

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,250
No. ?

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,180
It came up with two.

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,590
Have you heard of Thorazine, Alex?

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,860
I only mentioned it

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,610
because that's what ‭they're proposing for you --

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,410
a high dose, much more aggressive treatment

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,270
than what you're taking in the mornings now.

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,430
I'm the one holding them back, because I feel for you.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,900
I don't think that ‭you are a violent person.

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,830
A few outbursts don't define you.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,410
But you need to open up about the trauma that led you here,

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,890
starting with your father's abuse,

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,290
and then torture ‭at the hands of Mr. Ward,

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,400
and then S.H.I.E.L.D.

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,910
I remember everything.

33
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,580
That's a start.

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,220
But we need to drill down on how that makes you feel,

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,740
show them some improvement

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,340
so they don't drug you

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,230
to the point where thoughts are hard to come by, okay?

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,900
So, we can start anywhere.

39
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,510
April.

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,750
Okay. What happened in April?

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,390
April...

42
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,010
your daughter.

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,640
Just turned 3.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,180
I never spoke about --

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,800
Six weeks ago, during our Tuesday session, it was raining.

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,070
You always prop the window open with a pen.

47
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,910
Your wife called, ‭and you answered after one ring.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,230
Tight leash, huh?

49
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,180
You stepped outside to talk,

50
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,530
but the door's not as thick as you think.

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,430
April had a fever -- 103.2.

52
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,980
All those kids at the parties, a lot of germs.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,440
You said you'd be home early.

54
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,820
513 Elm Drive, right?

55
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,190
You know where I live?

56
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,190
You should really be more careful.

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,650
You never know what someone might do with that information.

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,310
I told you -- I remember everything.

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,680
I'd like ‭that Thorazine now, please.

60
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,540
‭Everything is stabilizing -- back in normal range.

61
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,810
Bit of good news.

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,090
How's the pain?

63
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,170
Nothing I can't handle. Thank you.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,700
Well, how's this? You okay?

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,690
- It's fine. - Good. Okay.

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,380
Well you need to stay warm.

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,930
can I get you anything to eat?

68
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,100
Mack, enough.

69
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,370
Seriously, if I had arms, I would strangle you right now.

70
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,660
How's the patient?

71
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,670
- Cranky. - How are you feeling?

72
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,840
The same way I was feeling

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,630
before you knew ‭anything was wrong with me.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,510
Thank you for asking, but, please, stop asking.

75
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,910
Fitz is gonna do the best prosthetics work

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,880
he's ever done for you,

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,860
but it may take some time.

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,150
We don't have the materials he needs here,

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,070
but we're gonna find a way to get them.

80
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,240
In the meantime, I need you to focus on resting and healing.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,810
Sitting still isn't my strong suit.

82
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,720
I know, but he'll make it worth the wait.

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,540
See?

84
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,560
People can't even tell the difference.

85
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,420
And, honestly, this one's way more fun.

86
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,270
- He's always adding - Does it feel the same?

87
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,930
Actually, no.

88
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,380
It doesn't feel at all, but you get used to it.

89
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,740
How are you gonna feel about dating someone with robo-parts?

90
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,540
Those aren't the parts that matter.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Mack!

92
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,050
What? Oh, no, come on. That's not what I meant.

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,410
What I meant was that the thing I hate about robots

94
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,780
is that they have no heart, no soul --

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,100
those are the parts that matter.

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,500
Nice save.

97
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
And sweet.

98
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,600
Okay. You can be annoying again.

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,320
Well, it's my turn now. Time to break up this party.

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,540
You need rest.

101
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,910
I need a beer.

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,510
I'll see what I can do about that.

103
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,030
In the meantime, you listen to the doc, all right?

104
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,820
We need to get out of here

105
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,690
and get Fitz what he needs to fix her.

106
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,050
I know, Mack, but it's one of many pressing concerns.

107
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,280
I was just coming to see you.

108
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,750
Tidings of comfort and joy?

109
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,130
Warnings of doom and gloom.

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,830
The, uh -- The Gravitonium device that we used

111
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,000
to seal the rift is barely strong enough.

112
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,930
It's duct tape on the Hoover Dam. It's not gonna hold.

113
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,570
How much time before the dam starts leaking?

114
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,580
Well, uh, it's hard to calculate that precisely,

115
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,150
but, based on the increased frequency of transit,

116
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,550
electromagnetic waves,

117
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,150
I'd say that our days were numbered.

118
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,650
Sorry. That was insensitive.

119
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,950
No, it wasn't. It's part of life. We're all gonna die.

120
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,420
Right now, we need to make sure it doesn't happen

121
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,880
to the entire planet all at once.

122
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,980
So, we need more Gravitonium

123
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,560
to seal the rift for good, right?

124
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,810
Yeah, but that's something we haven't seen

125
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,270
on this side of the future in a long time.

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,230
Sir...

127
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,040
I really think that we should have everybody on this.

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,730
Me too.

129
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,010
Let's not forget about Yo-Yo.

130
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,690
She can't help until we help her.

131
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,480
Daisy's hoping we can tackle both problems with one solution.

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,930
Cybertek.

133
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,630
The last time anyone saw Gravitonium in this time line

134
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,850
was at Cybertek's lab,

135
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,410
which happens to be the same company that built Deathlok's leg.

136
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,220
- Now we're talking. - Cybertek was dissolved.

137
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,190
Quinn's vanished. Raina's dead.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Gravitonium is still M.I.A.

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,590
Yeah, but we found ‭the names of the scientists

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,310
who worked under Ian Quinn, so...

141
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,450
Who's Ian Quinn?

142
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,580
Rich guy, bad guy.

143
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,470
What are you doing here?

144
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,490
Oh, I'm not part of the club?

145
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,230
I'm sorry. ‭I'll just go get my things,

146
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,440
and I'll go grab a cheeseburger.

147
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,320
Have a seat, Deke. I invited him.

148
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,290
He's seen more Gravitonium than any of us.

149
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
He may have some insight that we don't.

150
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,260
Okay. So, this is Quinn's Gravitonium guy,

151
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,240
Dr. Joseph Getty.

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,930
Also dead. We chased that lead.

153
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,500
Right, but here's where it gets interesting --

154
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,350
all of Cybertek's scientists are now dead, within the past two years,

155
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,020
and all of their death certificates were signed by one man...

156
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,590
Murray Jacobson.

157
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,470
What? So, you think it's a cover-up? They're still alive?

158
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,330
Yeah, it smells like it,

159
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,700
but this photo's all I could find on him.

160
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,930
You ran facial recognition?

161
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,410
I did, and I found his mug

162
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,410
associated with multiple aliases,

163
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,400
the most recent being Lewis Casalino,

164
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,240
a real-estate agent in Baton Rouge.

165
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,470
We need to talk to him.

166
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,350
So...we're going outside?

167
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,630
Yeah, they're kind of sparing no expense looking for you guys.

168
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,180
We'll leave under cover of night.

169
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,840
It's a risk we have to take.

170
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,820
If he can help us find Dr. Getty,

171
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,610
we may get a lead on Gravitonium.

172
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,870
Yeah. I'm going with you.

173
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,430
I thought you grounded yourself.

174
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,750
Yeah, I can't really destroy the world without my powers, so...

175
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,100
I can take care of myself.

176
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,710
I know. ‭I just want some fresh air.

177
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,130
Right. Well...fresh air for all of us.

178
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,700
- Have a seat, Deke. - Okay.

179
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,180
I need you to stay here.

180
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,860
See if you can help Fitz.

181
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,820
What? N-No. Come on.

182
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm -- I'm not a babysitter.

183
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,590
Do you have any idea how high my IQ is?

184
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,560
Actually, neither do I.

185
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,970
Nobody actually cared about that in the future.

186
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,840
Intelligence was measured by how long you could survive.

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,420
Then be smart and stay here.

188
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,030
Hello.

189
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,100
What is this place?

190
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,920
Where are we?!

191
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,760
Lewis Casalino?

192
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,600
AKA Murray Jacobson, William Pratt,

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,740
Gene Kline, Marion Cobretti.

194
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,090
He's armed, ‭and he's coming your way.

195
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,050
Show yourself, or I'll drop you.

196
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,370
Drop the gun. We just want to talk.

197
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,550
You heard him -- drop the gun.

198
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,090
Listen, ladycakes,

199
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,760
I take orders from two people -- no one and not you.

200
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Candy Man?

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,430
Mack Hammer?

202
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,070
Well, I'll be damned.

203
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,420
Do I owe you money?

204
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,170
Hey, it's probably the other way around, brother.

205
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,940
Oh, it's good to see you.

206
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,980
Good to see you.

207
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,820
There he is -- Tony "Candy Man" Caine.

208
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,950
We were roommates ‭freshman year at the Academy.

209
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,240
Why'd they call you "Candy Man"?

210
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,500
Well, Tony was the kind of guy who could get you anything --

211
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,090
you know, fake I.D.S,

212
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,930
backstage passes, test answers.

213
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,270
What did I get for all my troubles?

214
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,710
Booted from the Academy.

215
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,120
Well, you also never went to class.

216
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,680
Oh, yeah, well, I really wasn't a books-and-test kind of guy.

217
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,530
That was Mack -- never missed a class, never broke a rule.

218
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,010
They called us the Saint and the Sinner.

219
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,190
Wait. Could we get back to "Mack Hammer," please?

220
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,000
He made the mistake of telling us

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,650
that he was obsessed with MC Hammer in high school.

223
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,490
Okay.

224
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,800
Wait. Where's your picture?

225
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,940
‭- Don't -- - ‭Oh, my, my.

226
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,910
- There he is. That's it. - You can't unsee that, Mack.

227
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,510
All right, this does not leave the plane.

228
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,990
All right, guys, guys, I'm guessing you didn't track me down

229
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,190
to relive good memories and awesome haircuts.

230
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,120
You're right.

231
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,250
We're looking ‭for a Cybertek scientist

232
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,880
named Joseph Getty.

233
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,390
And why would I know him?

234
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,250
You signed his death certificate.

235
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,900
If he's still alive, he may have valuable information for us.

236
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,030
He could help us keep the world

237
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,900
from shattering into a billion pieces.

238
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,500
Okay.

239
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,190
You guys ever hear of Project Paperclip?

240
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,920
Secret program ‭to recruit Nazi scientists

241
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,010
after World War II.

242
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,020
Yeah, and the exact same thing happened with Hydra

243
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,900
for those worthy of a second chance.

244
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,350
And it was my job to give them new identities,

245
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,030
new lives, erase the old ones.

246
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,890
So, you know where he is.

247
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,400
We need to talk to him, Tony.

248
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,130
Well, if the Mack Hammer's willing to break the rules,

249
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,900
this has got to be bad.

250
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,080
Yeah, doomsday bad.

251
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,910
Following the rules is no longer an option.

252
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,510
Look what I found in storage.

253
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,850
Baseball, right?

254
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,800
Did everybody have really big hands?

255
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
'Cause this is crazy.

256
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,150
There's another one if you want to play.

257
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,170
I'm monitoring ‭a highly volatile situation.

258
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,660
Well, yeah, I'm trying to help.

259
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,960
You don't have to be such a cranky, old man about it.

260
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,280
If you're stuck on a problem, you should take a break.

261
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,330
My mom used to tell me

262
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,300
about this guy named Albert Einstein.

263
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,150
He says that play is the highest form of research.

264
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,250
I'm not gonna play catch with you.

265
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,290
I've got stuff to... Okay?

266
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,820
Well, why don't I stay here

267
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,720
and stare at the numbers for a little while?

268
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,160
You can go visit Mrs. Fitz.

269
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,520
You guys just got married. All the grown-ups are gone.

270
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
I bet she's just dying for a little post-wedding yee-haw.

271
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,270
Okay, do you know what, Einstein? You're right.

272
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,660
I need a break, so let's play ball.

273
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,170
Let's play ball. Come on.

274
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Okay. Toss me the ball, and we'll play fetch.

275
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,190
Ready?

276
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,620
Damn. It's happening again.

277
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,490
We are experiencing another anomaly flare.

278
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,640
If you see something that doesn't belong here,

279
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,330
it's not real.

280
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,630
Kill it by any means necessary.

281
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,410
What happened?

282
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,350
You okay?

283
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,800
I woke up.

284
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,450
I forgot I didn't have arms.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,180
Okay, let's just get you back up there.

286
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,280
Please, leave me alone.

287
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,000
I just want to sit here.

288
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,250
I want to be with Mack forever,

289
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,290
and I want ‭to have children with him.

290
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,280
And you will.

291
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,270
This doesn't change anything.

292
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,480
Look at me.

293
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,850
What I saw, what I heard --

294
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,850
that's all happening.

295
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,020
There's no future but the one I saw.

296
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,590
No, that's not true.

297
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,740
We can change it.

298
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,660
We will change it.

299
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,320
No.

300
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,580
Nothing's gonna change it.

301
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,150
You're different, man.

302
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,490
You hated violence.

303
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,300
Now look at this -- you got this shotgun ax thing.

304
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,630
You're one of America's most wanted.

305
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, it's badass and everything, don't get me wrong,

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,090
but, dude, what happened?

307
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,130
There are a lot of dark things going on in this world

308
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,130
that people should never have to see.

309
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,260
I won't let the people I love get hurt by them.

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,470
Not anymore.

311
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,690
So, that's why you were asking about the Deathlok program.

312
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,790
I'm sorry, man. It's a dead end.

313
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,390
I know Cybertek coerced a lot of people,

314
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,070
but I'm still not sure how I feel

315
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,710
about a bunch of their scientists

316
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,080
getting clean slates and walking among us.

317
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,480
What if one of them has the key to saving you?

318
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,330
You were hoping Cybertek could solve more than two problems.

319
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,980
I am not gonna be the next John Garrett.

320
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,760
The answer's no.

321
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,820
Okay, just hear me out for a second.

322
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,110
Cybertek had a whole team of people

323
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,860
whose only job was to keep Garrett alive.

324
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,010
What if one of them could do the same for you?

325
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,340
Absolutely not. That's an order.

326
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,500
If there's a chance to save your life, why not try?

327
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,810
Because I already had one unnatural life extension,

328
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,210
and I don't want another.

329
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,950
You both have to accept that.

330
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,160
Not gonna happen.

331
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,370
Not a chance.

332
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,690
He was our shield when we needed it,

333
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,780
and like it or not,

334
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,420
we're gonna be his.

335
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,790
Come on in. Join the party.

336
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Wow. You can talk.

337
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,180
When I feel like it.

338
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,970
What is this place?

339
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,640
A safe house.

340
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,080
Why are you here?

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,490
I live here.

342
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,630
Why am I here?

343
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,830
You will get ‭all of your questions answered

344
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,110
when you get them answered.

345
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,690
From who?

346
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,420
Mother.

347
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,030
What?

348
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,330
You still have that scar...

349
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,770
that you got when you were a kid?

350
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,740
How did you know?

351
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,570
We used to play together.

352
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,410
Ruby, right?

353
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,280
I don't remember you.

354
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,670
You hit your head on the kitchen counter.

355
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,250
That's how you got it.

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,270
I remember the floor --

357
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,660
Black-and-white checkers.

358
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,130
I was supposed to be watching you, so I got blamed.

359
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,210
My father beat me ‭in front of you and your mother.

360
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,180
I want to see her... now.

361
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,810
Well, this can't be good.

362
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,760
Did they find me?

363
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,470
Do I have to relocate again?

364
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,400
Everything's okay. ‭This isn't an official visit.

365
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,340
I just need you to help me find something.

366
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,930
What?

367
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,510
Gravitonium.

368
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,830
It's okay. ‭He's an old friend of mine.

369
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,180
You can trust him. ‭He's one of the good guys.

370
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D.

371
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,390
No, no. They're the bad guys now.

372
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,130
I can't be seen talking to a criminal!

373
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,200
Says the guy who used to work for Hydra.

374
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,150
Listen, he had to work for them.

375
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,100
They were threatening to kill his family.

376
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,910
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,230
I still regret everything I did for them,

378
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,390
but I'm paying for my sins.

379
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,430
Saving the world will pay for them all.

380
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,530
What do you need to know?

381
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,770
What happened to the Gravitonium?

382
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,070
They put it on a cargo ship, the Principia,

383
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,860
to transport it to a facility in the Pacific, but...

384
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,600
never made it.

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,830
Why? What happened?

386
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,040
It sank during a thunderstorm.

387
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,860
If you want Gravitonium,

388
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,440
you're gonna have to reach 5 miles

389
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,120
down into the ocean to get it.

390
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,720
We're looking in an area that they've already searched.

391
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,730
There's nothing there.

392
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,710
I expanded the search range 100 miles in every direction

393
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,840
from the coordinates at which it last made contact.

394
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,070
Bathymetric maps don't show anything.

395
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,470
Sonar doesn't pick up any deviations.

396
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,970
So, maybe they were hijacked by pirates.

397
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,530
He said it went down in a storm.

398
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,130
Did you ever consider he might be lying?

399
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,390
He was Hydra.

400
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,560
Mack believes him.

401
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,830
Keep looking.

402
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,420
Look at all that water.

403
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,210
‭You should get some rest.

404
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,320
You haven't slept all night.

405
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,930
I'm fine. I'm fine. I just --

406
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,050
I don't know where else to look,

407
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,020
and even if we do find it,

408
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,760
I don't know how we salvage it from that depth.

409
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,700
How deep?

410
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,380
5 miles where we're looking.

411
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,560
5 miles?!

412
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,210
Are you serious? What's it like down there?

413
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,340
- Dark. - It's cold.

414
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,000
So, did you guys go visit, like, on holiday?

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,450
Do they have hotels, or is that, like --

416
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,750
Okay, do you know what? Just go.

417
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,310
Please, please, just go,

418
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,120
because you are giving me a headache.

419
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,270
Well, I'm sorry that I have never seen an ocean before.

420
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,520
Where I was born,

421
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,200
you guys already blew up the planet,

422
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,310
so thank you very much for your service.

423
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,240
He never stops.

424
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,400
It's like somebody let Scrappy-Doo in here.

425
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,420
You can't be so hard on him.

426
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,230
We both know what it's like

427
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,350
to be pulled into a strange world.

428
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,790
Plus, he has exquisite taste in wedding rings.

429
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,600
Can you believe ‭that we're married...

430
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,200
wife?

431
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,250
I cannot, husband.

432
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,010
Do you think we'll ever get used to it, husband?

433
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
No, I do not, wife.

434
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,040
Hey, I was thinking -- we should hyphenate our last name, yeah?

435
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,470
Uh, yeah, of course.

436
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,270
Mr. And Mrs. Simmons-Fitz.

437
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,520
‭Sounds great.

438
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,700
Just rolls right off the tongue.

439
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,850
Yeah, right off.

440
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,460
Let her go...

441
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,360
or they will kill you.

442
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,770
Why am I here?

443
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,260
They wanted to chemically lobotomize you,

444
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,690
so I had you transferred.

445
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,700
Maybe that's what I wanted.

446
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,720
It's good to see you, Werner, after all these years.

447
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,350
It's Alex -- Alex Braun.

448
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,730
I don't want anything to do with my father or his name

449
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,030
or Hydra.

450
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,940
Hydra.

451
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,800
Such a boys' club.

452
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,240
So much testosterone.

453
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,350
If you're not Hydra,

454
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,390
why were you always visiting my father?

455
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh, we had overlapping interests back then...

456
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,590
but I hated his guts, if we're being honest.

457
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,340
I can use you, Alex.

458
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,380
I know what you can do,

459
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,060
'cause I've read your S.H.I.E.L.D. File,

460
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,840
your psych evaluations.

461
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,530
I've pieced it all together.

462
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,550
S.H.I.E.L.D. zapped your brain

463
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,360
when you were in the memory enhancer.

464
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,320
Something was bound to happen.

465
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,690
I mean, h-how much do you remember?

466
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,560
What you mean is, how much do I remember

467
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,970
that my father said or did or -- or wrote down?

468
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
It's valuable information.

469
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,530
And your father is one of the reasons

470
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,290
that Hydra went off the rails.

471
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,340
See, what I'm building here is something new,

472
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,010
a better future for you -- for you and for Ruby.

473
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,630
Can you help me do that, Alex?

474
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,950
Go to hell.

475
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,880
I am so sorry you feel that way.

476
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,010
Kill me.

477
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,170
I don't care.

478
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,430
I'm not gonna kill you, Alex.

479
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,470
Tomorrow morning, I'll take you wherever it is you want to go.

480
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,630
You're free. Go.

481
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,540
It's my gift to you.

482
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,040
Gain his trust,

483
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,400
his love --

484
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,780
whatever it is you need to do to get inside his head.

485
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,320
We need that information.

486
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,990
Ruby.

487
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,790
Stick to the books this time.

488
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,620
Don't you go off the rails.

489
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,030
Oh, my God.

490
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,140
I've got to meet the chef that invented these.

491
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,270
Deke!

492
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,020
Who's there?

493
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,890
Mom?

494
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,510
There you are, sweetie.

495
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,230
I have been looking all over for you.

496
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,630
No, not -- not real.

497
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,360
- Not real. - ‭Put that down.

498
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,580
You'll cut yourself.

499
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,900
Are you getting enough to eat here?

500
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,810
I see you're making some friends.

501
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,490
I don't know if I'd call them friends.

502
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,130
You like them. I can tell.

503
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,570
S-Some, maybe.

504
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,470
And that Daisy girl is cute.

505
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,030
Mom, no, she's not.

506
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,230
Stop it.

507
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,490
Remember, sweetie,

508
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,700
the steps you take don't need to be big.

509
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,260
They just need to take you in the right direction.

510
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,310
You always used to say that.

511
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,370
And my mom said it to me.

512
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,940
So, what are you saying? Are you saying that I...

513
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,090
You should walk away.

514
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,710
You know what happens when you care about someone.

515
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,320
No!

516
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,040
- Deke? - ‭No.

517
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,460
You okay?

518
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,640
You look like you've had a fright.

519
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,270
I just saw...another one of those fear things.

520
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,340
I need a Zima.

521
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,920
You shouldn't be alone.

522
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,860
Come back to control. Fitz didn't mean --

523
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,330
Fitz thinks I'm an idiot,

524
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,490
like I don't know up from down.

525
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,400
Well, tell him I'm sorry that I was born in a place

526
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,760
that doesn't have oceans or air or -- or --

527
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,340
You know, and, technically,

528
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,610
there is no up and down in space.

529
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,730
It's all the same thing.

530
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,290
So you can tell him to take all that

531
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,010
science mumbo jumbo and shove it up --

532
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,820
Wait.

533
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,050
It's all the same thing.

534
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,760
You need to look up in the sky.

535
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,660
Our ships float and sink -- they don't fly.

536
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,570
I'm sorry, Deke,

537
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,320
but those are spaceships.

538
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,480
But what if the ship can fly?

539
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,990
It was carrying Gravitonium during a storm.

540
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,010
If it got hit by lightning...

541
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,030
Could have charged the Gravitonium.

542
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,770
And generated a gravity field around the entire ship.

543
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,530
Okay, well, if it was up in the atmosphere,

544
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,470
it would have been tossed about by air currents all these years.

545
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,200
It could be anywhere.

546
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,170
Yeah, so we need to analyze

547
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,450
wind and weather patterns, air currents,

548
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,750
starting from the night it disappeared

549
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,070
and try and build a workable algorithm.

550
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,350
Yeah. That. Let's do all that.

551
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,100
Anything?

552
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,030
Yeah. More clouds.

553
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,040
We're looking ‭for a needle in a haystack.

554
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,300
Or a flying boat.

555
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,630
You got to be kidding me.

556
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,120
Holy moly!

557
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,840
You guys see stuff like this all the time?

558
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,290
- Pretty much. - Yeah. - Yep.

559
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,590
No!

560
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,110
No, get aw-- get away!

561
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,200
I heard screaming.

562
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,910
I don't just remember words and facts.

563
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,130
I remember pain --

564
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,950
every beating I've ever taken,

565
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,240
like it's new.

566
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,150
Over and over.

567
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,150
Well, that...

568
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,730
has got to suck.

569
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,080
I never knew my father.

570
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,160
But my mother --

571
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,670
she's a tyrant.

572
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,990
Keeps me locked up here,

573
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,160
makes me do things that I don't want to do.

574
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,480
She's using me to get to you.

575
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,430
Everything I did -- ignoring you,

576
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,960
letting you touch me,

577
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,440
taking me hostage --

578
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,970
that was all planned,

579
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,170
the grand seduction of Werner von Strucker.

580
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,700
Gain his trust by any means necessary.

581
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,270
You made the right decision.

582
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,690
She doesn't care about you or me --

583
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,770
she only wants what's in your head.

584
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,010
But whatever she's planning, it's not gonna be any different

585
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,080
than Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D...

586
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,220
unless...

587
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,530
Unless what?

588
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,780
It doesn't have to be her team.

589
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,900
It could be our team...

590
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,300
only she wouldn't know until it was too late.

591
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,220
I don't want to be part of any team.

592
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,950
I just want to go somewhere far away.

593
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,450
With all of those bad memories?

594
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,280
Maybe the key is to bury them

595
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,610
under newer, happier memories.

596
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,340
If you're not here tomorrow...

597
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,780
I'll understand.

598
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,970
But if you are...

599
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,990
?Davis has us in hover mode.

600
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,490
You sure you don't need me down there?

601
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,390
I need someone on the thing

602
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,640
that's actually supposed to be in the air

603
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,280
in case the bottom drops out on us.

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,300
I trust you way more than Davis to fly that crazy rescue.

605
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,410
I hear you and don't disagree.

606
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,070
And don't forget to breathe your oxygen.

607
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,440
Five minutes without it, you'll get really loopy.

608
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,580
Okay, camera's on.

609
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,020
May, Fitz, you reading this?

610
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,400
Copy that. Crystal clear.

611
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,150
Yep, copy that. Looking good.

612
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,430
Got to admit -- it's kind of cool

613
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,330
walking around on a ship 25,000 feet up in the sky.

614
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,070
Fitz, how is this even possible?

615
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,260
When the Gravitonium was supercharged,

616
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,960
most likely by a lightning strike,

617
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,990
created an applied gravity field on the ship.

618
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,720
Same way the Gravity Puck works.

619
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,350
That means there's got to be Gravitonium there somewhere.

620
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,220
Well, Deck 1 is clear.

621
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,310
I think we found the crew.

622
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,770
That looks like severe hypoxia.

623
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,220
Let's keep moving.

624
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,790
We're in the engine room.

625
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,440
Looks like someone's been here before us.

626
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,670
Coulson.

627
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,610
Where's the Gravitonium?

628
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,100
Whoever they were, they didn't go home empty-handed.

629
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,600
What's keeping the ship in the air

630
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,190
if there's no Gravitonium?

631
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,060
It's not possible.

632
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,500
Guys, get down here!

633
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,780
What is it?

634
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,990
Gravitonium.

635
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,400
Not all of it, though.

636
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,360
About the size of a softball.

637
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,990
Must have got separated from the rest.

638
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,650
Okay, well, there might be enough there,

639
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,170
but there's a problem.

640
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,590
Yeah, there's always a problem.

641
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,260
You can't touch it or move it.

642
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,660
It's generating the gravity field

643
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,610
that's keeping you in the air.

644
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,920
We're not gonna leave it here.

645
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,160
Is there a plastic box anywhere?

646
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,580
Yeah, we got something. Why?

647
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,730
Okay, listen to me --

648
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,550
if you can box it up without touching it,

649
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,470
- you might be able to get it off the ship. - "Might"?

650
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,900
You got about 90 seconds before the gravity field dissipates.

651
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,860
After that, real gravity is gonna take over,

652
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,680
and the ship's gonna fall out of the sky.

653
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,550
That should be enough time.

654
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,690
All right.

655
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,770
Hey, Mack Hammer.

656
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,840
Can't touch this.

657
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,190
Now is not the time.

658
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,790
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

659
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,480
Clock's ticking.

660
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,990
Let's go before this floating ship

661
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,680
drops miles into the ocean.

662
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,110
On a mission with the two things I fear most --

663
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,310
drowning and heights.

664
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,090
Oh, make that three things.

665
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,080
What are those things?

666
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,270
One of Hale's flying monkeys.

667
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,750
There's another one!

668
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,770
They've got us flanked!

669
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,620
Mack!

670
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,770
They need to get off that ship.

671
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,290
They don't have much time.

672
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,850
You've got less than a minute.

673
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,180
Get the hell out of that ship.

674
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,310
Working on it.

675
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,370
Mack, run for it!

676
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,040
Go to the module. I'll take care of these guys!

677
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,570
- We got to get out! - We don't have time for this.

678
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,380
Go! I know what I'm doing!

679
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,620
It's Hammer Time.

680
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,540
This is not the Mack I used to know.

681
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm on my way.

682
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,750
And I'm bringing a couple of guests.

683
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,890
General Hale.

684
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,210
What is it?

685
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,910
Some of the old Sleeper Mechs recently came back online.

686
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,840
Which ones?

687
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,180
The ones you left on the Principia,

688
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,420
in case anyone found it.

689
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,880
We should have blown it out of the sky when we had a chance.

690
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,330
Yeah, it's too risky.

691
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,610
We don't know enough about the Gravitonium.

692
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,450
It could have responded like a nuclear reactor

693
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,890
and set the ozone on fire.

694
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,060
Well, now someone knows about it. Who?

695
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,580
S.H.I.E.L.D.

696
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,240
You know, I wouldn't have believed it

697
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,800
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

698
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,580
Thanks again for your help, Mr. Caine.

699
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,030
Sorry we had to drag you along.

700
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,680
I-I got to see a flying boat and a robot fight.

701
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,820
Best day ever.

702
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,630
We'll have someone take you home in a Quinjet when you're ready.

703
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,520
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

704
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,390
Good to see you again, Tony.

705
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,380
‭Take care.

706
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,740
Good to see you, too, Mack.

707
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,830
And, hey, about that Deathlok program --

708
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,060
your -- your friends were asking about it, too,

709
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,460
so I'm gonna do some digging, see what else I can find.

710
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,620
Yeah, anything, no matter how small.

711
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,040
You got it.

712
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,370
I'm sorry about yesterday.

713
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,040
I don't know who that was.

714
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,560
No need to apologize.

715
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,310
Recovery takes a toll physically and emotionally.

716
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,450
I'm just trying to not lose faith.

717
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,440
We're gonna change things.

718
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,960
That's the spirit.

719
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,410
Oh, I'm just holding onto that thing in case of emergency.

720
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,250
Don't beat yourself up while you're trying to heal.

721
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,960
Go slow.

722
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
The steps you take don't need to be big.

723
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,090
They just need to take you in the right direction.

724
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,180
Oh. Can we help you with something?

725
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,670
What's wrong, Deke?

726
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,850
Did you see another ghost from your past?

727
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,620
No, it wasn't a ghost.

728
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,680
I...

729
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,660
I just saw you standing there and, uh...

730
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,760
How are you?

731
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,300
What -- I'm --

732
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,340
I -- And, um -- They're -- They're --

733
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,410
They're back.

734
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,680
That -- That's what I came to tell you.

735
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,320
Great.

736
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,020
What?

737
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,340
Nothing.

738
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,080
Is that a new sweater?

739
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,260
Yo-Yo.

740
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,520
Hey, you're up.

741
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,580
One ball of Gravitonium.

742
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,330
Thank you.

743
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,250
Deke, are you coming, or is this another play day?

744
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,940
Yeah, after you, Grandpa.

745
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,030
I think they're growing on each other.

746
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,440
I just hope there's enough Gravitonium for them to work with.

747
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,640
And I think it's safe to say General Hale has the rest.

748
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,330
I'm starting to think she's more than just an overzealous general.

749
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,520
I think you're right.

750
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,530
Guess what I got you.

751
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,820
I don't know. I'm stumped.

752
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,430
So we're doing those jokes now?

753
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,860
No. No more of that,

754
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,410
or I won't share these with you.

755
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh, that's right -- I got you something else.

756
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,210
Arms.

757
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,170
We'll return in a moment.

758
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,650
I thought about what you said.

759
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,820
You're right.

760
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,090
The future's ours.

761
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,080
Then you should see who else we've got.

762
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,380
One of your father's old experiments...

763
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,930
but I don't need to tell you that.

764
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,700
You remember everything.

765
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,750
Nice work.

766
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,430
How did you convince him to stay?

767
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,250
I told him the truth.
