1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,130
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,620
Talbot already gave up the location of the chamber.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,950
Yes, and we're waiting for Strucker

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,590
to show us how to put it together.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
My father kept everything separate.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,000
There's no single journal

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,620
that explains how the chamber works.

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,980
We may be running out of time.

9
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,260
My mother wanted to join forces with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,060
with Daisy Johnson.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,350
The Gravitonium is meant for you.

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,900
- We have to find -- - Phillip J. Coulson.

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,510
Okay, let's start searching for landmarks that might match.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,580
It won't be easy.

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,110
But that might be where he is.

16
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,090
Daisy's taking a long shot to find where Hale is keeping Coulson,

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,310
but we have something concrete

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,950
that can get us one step ahead of her.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,690
Hale may be after a weapon powered by Gravitonium,

20
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,840
probably in a location

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
that Malick turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

22
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,030
We have coordinates to three locations,

23
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,640
so we'll start with the closest

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,530
and hope we don't find company when we get there.

25
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,290
Creel has broken out Talbot and Coulson.

26
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,730
Gear up and stop them.

27
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,270
Here we go.

28
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,830
We're on Earth, right?

29
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,570
Feels good to be home.

30
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,370
Just didn't think it'd be under these circumstances.

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,840
Did you pack the explosives?

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,730
- I did. - And the extra ammunition?

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,000
Of course.

34
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,600
I just want this to work.

35
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,140
After everything we've done to get here.

36
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,410
You made a choice. Don't look back.

37
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,730
What are the chances that we find this weapon here?

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,650
Gideon Malick hinted

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,160
that this place was a crucial R&D site for Hydra.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,180
It's our best bet, by far.

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,380
Autopilot will land the Quinjet somewhere nearby,

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,070
keep it cloaked until we get back.

43
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,920
Ready if you are.

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,010
So ready.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,370
I was thinking we could come back to England

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,990
for our honeymoon -- if we ever got one.

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,310
Sounds perfect!

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,480
Don't make me the third wheel, guys.

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,630
No trouble with the straps this time.

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,110
We've come a long way!

51
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,590
I got to take five.

52
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,600
No, no, no. No, no, no. We could've been followed.

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,650
We can't stop now. Come on.

54
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,050
Come on. What do you care?

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,100
You left me alone for months, Phil.

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,860
I'm sure you can manage another couple of minutes, can't you?

57
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,550
Don't jump down his throat. He's all you got.

58
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,410
For what it's worth,

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,580
I'm sorry ‭we didn't find you sooner.

60
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,080
Now come on.

61
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,450
Just trying to hold out, Phil.

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,870
Where were you?

63
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,990
We were in the future.

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,460
You were in the future.

65
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,450
What, do you guys live in some fifth-dimension freak show?

66
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,500
I'd say that's a ‭relatively accurate description

67
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,710
- of our day-to-day life. - Yeah, well, not mine.

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,340
If we get out of here, I'm -- I'm done!

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,010
I'm too jumbled as it is.

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,280
You gonna let someone like Hale get the best of you?

71
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,930
She broke me, Phil.

72
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,510
I let down the Air Force, my country...

73
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,260
...and I let down my family.

74
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,630
I'm not gonna be able to look Carla in the eye again.

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,090
I promise you, no one's gonna see it that way.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,670
Yeah? Well, I do.

77
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,990
It's kind of a moot point

78
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,040
if we freeze to death out here, isn't it?

79
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,610
That's why we got to keep moving.

80
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,600
We're never gonna find them.

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,920
We've been circling the Trident Range for hours,

82
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,940
and there's still no sign of Coulson and whoever he's with.

83
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,840
Well, that's a surprise,

84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,790
considering we're following such a detailed map.

85
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,880
Robin's been right about everything else.

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, well, ‭what if this doesn't happen

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,840
for another month or -- or a year?

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,130
Would it kill her to draw a calendar?

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,050
Why don't you go ask her?

90
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,130
Well, I thought that I left all this prophecy crap back in the future.

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,330
Deke, you're not helping.

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,380
Maybe we should change tactics.

93
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,110
What are you thinking?

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,010
The cloud cover's too thick to see through anyway.

95
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,690
We should land, canvass the area on foot,

96
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,640
let Coulson find us.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,860
Hale's hideout could be nearby. We'd be exposed.

98
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,820
Give him a shot.

99
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,220
If you think it's the right call.

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,220
Davis, find a place to set her down.

101
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,610
Okay. Where'd you have in mind?

102
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,630
Anywhere.

103
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,480
We should start looking for shelter.

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,260
Maybe get a fire going.

105
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,040
Were you ever a Boy Scout?

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,600
Brigadier General ‭outranks a Boy Scout, Coul--

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,110
Run.

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,950
No, come on. We got to keep moving. Come on.

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,060
You got your powers back.

110
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,220
It's a long story. May, get them back to the Zephyr.

111
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,050
- I'll take care of her. - Not a chance.

112
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,650
It's a rescue mission. Look at them.

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,230
So, how'd you find us?

114
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,100
Robin.

115
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,060
A little bit like cheating, don't you think?

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Keep moving.

117
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,270
And, Deke, watch their back. That's an order.

118
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,550
The legendary Quake.

119
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,620
You know, you're much prettier in person.

120
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,900
And meaner, so I'd stay where you are.

121
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,990
It's funny.

122
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,150
I have your poster up on my wall.

123
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,020
You're like that, uh...hero...

124
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,050
that every little girl wants to be when they grow up.

125
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,370
Looks like you made a wrong turn along the way.

126
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,880
No.

127
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,590
I'm just engineered differently.

128
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,610
I don't want to be you.

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,160
I want to beat you.

130
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,020
You can certainly try.

131
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't think ‭she's getting up from that.

132
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,050
What are you still doing here?

133
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,070
I thought she had you for a sec, but --

134
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,470
Deke!

135
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,140
We got to get out of here. Let's go.

136
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,400
I need an extraction team at this location.

137
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,860
Get this plane in the air.

138
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,810
We got you.

139
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,490
I can't stop the bleeding.

140
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,170
Grab the hemostatic granules.

141
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,800
It's okay.

142
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,710
Come on.

143
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,600
Scissors.

144
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,380
Hope this thing has instructions.

145
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,820
- Okay, hold him still. - That's not a good sign.

146
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,870
- It's working. - This is only a temporary fix.

147
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,730
He's gonna need ‭actual medical attention.

148
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,520
Call ahead to Simmons. Give her a heads-up.

149
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
No one's answering.

150
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,420
Can you hold on until we make it to the Lighthouse?

151
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,980
Just get us there as fast as you can.

152
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,580
It's about damn time.

153
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,700
The code is 6-2-8-8-2.

154
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,650
What the hell? Is Fitz evil again?

155
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,210
Yo-Yo and Simmons broke him out.

156
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,780
W-why? Where did they go?

157
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,300
Looks like there may be a way in up here.

158
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,450
Radiation poisoning would be a whole new way

159
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,100
to find out we can still die.

160
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,530
- Should we turn back? - No need.

161
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,510
Primula vulgaris -- primrose.

162
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,740
I used to pick these as a girl.

163
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,550
I mean, it's a hardy species,

164
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,090
but even it couldn't survive in irradiated soil.

165
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,830
You'll find more radiation in a dentist's office.

166
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,950
Talbot probably just posted these signs to keep out interlopers.

167
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,700
They won't scare off Hydra.

168
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,700
Let me.

169
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,050
Well, looks like getting your arms chopped off isn't all bad.

170
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,860
The -- Well -- Yeah -- It is -- Obviously, it's bad.

171
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,340
It's really bad getting your arms chopped off,

172
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,470
but maybe there is a silver lining --

173
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,280
Well, as much as I'm enjoying this day in the country,

174
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,390
we have a job to do.

175
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,350
After you, better half.

176
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,620
Here, take these.

177
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,710
We're landing soon.

178
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,060
That was reckless back there, Deke.

179
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,420
You this kind to everybody who takes a bullet for you?

180
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,650
- You were the reason we had to retreat. - Well, I'm sorry.

181
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,950
Next time, I'll try to keep all my blood inside of my body.

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,530
I had Hale's daughter down for the count.

183
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,370
We could've captured her.

184
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,750
Yeah, she was down, and I was trying to secure her weapon,

185
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,960
like any other agent would have.

186
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,020
- You're not an agent. - Oh, really?

187
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,860
Well, then maybe you should stop ordering me around like one, then.

188
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,550
Because this top-dog thing doesn't suit you.

189
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,470
What does it matter if you don't listen?

190
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,620
I can't fight and protect your dumb ass at the same time.

191
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,500
You are the worst.

192
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,030
I -- I was trying to give you backup...

193
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,010
I didn't need your backup!

194
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,010
Even though you threatened to kill me

195
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,730
a couple of dozen times --

196
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,370
Here. Have some water.

197
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,430
Deke.

198
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,170
Deke.

199
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,940
We need help over here!

200
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,420
Now!

201
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,830
Mack, where have you been?

202
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,610
Get Simmons. We need her.

203
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,520
She's not here. She and Yo-Yo locked me in Fitz's cell

204
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,690
and ran off to who knows where.

205
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,270
Fitz's cell?

206
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,600
Must be the long story you mentioned.

207
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,390
Yeah. I left you in charge. What the hell happened?

208
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,440
They think they can't be killed.

209
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,430
You try arguing with someone who's totally irrational.

210
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,690
We'll decide who's rational later.

211
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,340
- What are we gonna do for Deke? - He's coughing up blood.

212
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,320
If Simmons is AWOL, we have to get him to a hospital.

213
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,470
We don't have time for that.

214
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,630
Piper, you were in training

215
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,230
to be a field medic for the strike team.

216
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,350
- What are we looking at? - Uh, he's in shock.

217
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,070
If he doesn't get a blood transfusion soon --

218
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,400
No choice. Treat him here.

219
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,980
I have zero field experience. There's no way.

220
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,560
- I'm not a surgeon. - Just talk me through it.

221
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm not afraid of blood, and I got a steady hand.

222
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,760
You should put some ice on that.

223
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,010
That's not necessary.

224
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,290
- I need you at your best. - When am I not?

225
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,360
You know, I could've beaten Daisy Johnson today

226
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,750
if you hadn't forced her to run.

227
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,070
Too much of a risk. She's got an unfair advantage.

228
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,580
Once we complete our objective,

229
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,390
you'll be able to beat her without breaking a sweat.

230
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,030
So move up the timetable, then.

231
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,830
No, not until Creel tells us more about the Gravitonium.

232
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,890
Now get in.

233
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,300
Are you serious?

234
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,830
You went against my orders, nearly murdered Creel.

235
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,980
- We need him for this. - For what?

236
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,200
He's dangerous.

237
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,270
He's completely out of your control.

238
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,780
Yes, as are you.

239
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,330
That's why I'm putting you both back in your cage.

240
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,070
Do I need to force you?

241
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,580
Power's being diverted to a space on the second floor,

242
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,520
but according to this plan, there's nothing there.

243
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,890
Bad guys rarely mark their evil lairs on blueprints.

244
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,920
We'll find a way to locate it once we get inside.

245
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
We may have to improvise that bit.

246
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,800
We're improving all the bits.

247
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,180
Any idea what the weapon in there is?

248
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,420
We'll blow it up regardless.

249
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,290
Hold on.

250
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,610
I'm reading ‭an encrypted radio signal.

251
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,740
Coming from where?

252
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
Coming here. Move.

253
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,150
Inside.

254
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Anton Ivanov is providing security.

255
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,680
Means we're in the right place.

256
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,630
And that we've lost our advantage.

257
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,120
A man who can't die, huh?

258
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,180
Maravilloso.

259
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,860
Almost cleaned out.

260
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,890
Okay. Where do we go from here?

261
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,130
I think he has a hemothorax -- blood in his chest cavity.

262
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,780
We need to stop the bleeding and drain it.

263
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,760
You're gonna need to cut into the wound

264
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,970
so we can see what we're doing.

265
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,050
- What about anesthesia? - Well, he's already unconscious,

266
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,270
and I haven't read that chapter yet,

267
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,770
so we'll just figure it out as we go.

268
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,840
So, this kid's from the future?

269
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,450
Yeah. And in that future, Earth is gone,

270
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,840
and the last of humanity is enslaved by alien overlords.

271
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,680
Alien...over...

272
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,840
I should've stayed in my cell.

273
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,910
You're telling me that we got our asses handed to us

274
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,740
by little green men.

275
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,590
They were big and blue.

276
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,830
But they didn't crack the world apart.

277
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,020
They said it was Daisy.

278
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,540
And you're still sending her on missions?

279
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,250
I need her leading missions.

280
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,060
I got an old injury acting up.

281
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,560
Not sure what my timetable is, exactly.

282
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,990
Oh, for the love of flapjacks.

283
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,950
Do you ever have any good news?

284
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,140
There's a young Inhuman who's seen a better future.

285
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,030
We're working toward that.

286
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,300
Anything else we can do for him?

287
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,580
We're here if they need a hand.

288
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,810
Can I talk to you for a second?

289
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,080
We need to talk about Fitz-Simmons and Yo-Yo.

290
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,730
If they really believe they can't be killed --

291
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,910
That's not the conversation we're having right now.

292
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
Then, what conversation are we having right now?

293
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,250
Well, the one where you explain

294
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,750
all the stupid decisions you've been making recently.

295
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,930
That's rather specific.

296
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,840
Giving yourself up to Hale was a mistake.

297
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,390
She was about to blow up the Zephyr.

298
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,850
- What did you want me to do? - I don't know.

299
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,420
Stall her long enough for me to get to the cockpit.

300
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,020
You hold on while I throw the plane

301
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,330
into a vertical dive, maybe.

302
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,120
- Knock out Creel -- -You gonna get to a point?

303
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,280
My point is, you didn't even try.

304
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,870
You just rolled over without a fight.

305
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,090
I did what I thought was best, and it got results.

306
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,460
We rescued Talbot ‭and learned about Hale's agenda.

307
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,420
Yeah, and nearly lost Deke in the process.

308
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,580
He should've listened to Daisy.

309
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,880
Well, maybe Daisy shouldn't have been put in that position

310
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,750
in the first place.

311
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,450
You don't think she should lead?

312
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,830
I didn't say that.

313
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,730
But she does need time. She's questioning herself.

314
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,130
- I question myself every day -- - Let me speak.

315
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,460
All Daisy could think about was getting you back.

316
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,910
She's not ready for your job, Phil.

317
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,880
She has to be. My time is running out.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,400
Because you're being irresponsible.

319
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,990
You said you weren't in a hurry to die,

320
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,900
but you're not acting like it.

321
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,870
So this isn't so much about my stupidity

322
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,070
as it is about me dying.

323
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,780
Seems like one thing led to the other.

324
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,890
You realize this isn't easy for me, but I've accepted it.

325
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,340
Which is the problem.

326
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,250
Maybe I'm reckless.

327
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,180
But if this is the end,

328
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,090
better to go out ‭doing something that matters.

329
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,030
No.

330
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,870
You don't get to make that decision alone.

331
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,580
That decision is made with the people who love you.

332
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,100
- May - and that's me.

333
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
I love you.

334
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,310
I thought that would shut you up.

335
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,590
You're not supposed to be here.

336
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,330
I wanted you to know before her.

337
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,600
It's all here.

338
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,480
Are you ready?

339
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,290
She won't let me.

340
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,410
Why?

341
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,960
More tests.

342
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,390
Creel betrayed us,

343
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,730
but she'll still listen to every word that he says.

344
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,060
You said this was ours.

345
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,160
You don't have to follow her orders anymore.

346
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,090
She locked me in here. I don't have a choice.

347
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,250
Of course you do.

348
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,490
You could tear her apart if you wanted to.

349
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,980
So why don't you?

350
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,420
I don't know.

351
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,470
The mechs are still sending signals back and forth.

352
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,770
- We should keep following it. - And then sneak past them?

353
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,780
Yeah, call that plan A.

354
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,970
Plan A seems ambitious.

355
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,630
Well

356
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,710
that's why we have a plan B.

357
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,670
Yes, General, we have found the chamber.

358
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,640
We are looking it over as we speak.

359
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,150
We'll join you as soon as Strucker finishes the plans.

360
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,860
Keep it secure until then.

361
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,200
That will not be a problem so long as you keep your word.

362
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,640
You'll have your chance with the chamber.

363
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,300
Another step toward becoming the superior man.

364
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,250
I hope it is as powerful as you promised.

365
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,600
As do I.

366
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,830
What was that?

367
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,190
Nothing I can't handle.

368
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,580
What were those mechs guarding?

369
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,330
This isn't connected to a water main.

370
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,880
Just destroy all of it.

371
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,870
Should've brought more explosives.

372
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,700
Won't be long until they realize

373
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,650
we've slipped through their defenses...

374
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,980
We can cut out its heart once we work out what this thing does,

375
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,900
and to whom.

376
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,730
Mr. Ivanov -- ‭you think he could be trusted?

377
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,390
For the moment, ‭his interests align with mine.

378
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,760
He wants to be first into the chamber.

379
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,370
I want to see what it does to human flesh.

380
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,850
Would you like me to accompany you?

381
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,460
No, I want you to stay focused on our contingency plan.

382
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,710
You know the message that needs to be sent.

383
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,080
Of course, General.

384
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,090
Ruby.

385
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,970
You didn't think I'd still be here.

386
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,620
I assumed Strucker opened the door.

387
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm surprised you're not with him right now.

388
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,440
Where would we go?

389
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,300
It doesn't matter if there's a lock on that door or not.

390
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,600
I'd never run from you.

391
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,720
I've kept you safe.

392
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,240
You've kept me obedient.

393
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,080
And I've let you control me.

394
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,630
And I have no idea why.

395
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,780
Ruby, I have great plans for you.

396
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,220
Like Whitehall had great plans for you?

397
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,480
You have always said that you wanted a choice,

398
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,410
but you've never given me one.

399
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,610
I-I know that I've demanded a lot from you recently,

400
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,150
- but I - No, Mom, you've demanded the impossible,

401
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,960
and I have tried to be

402
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,800
everything that you wanted me to be.

403
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,940
- I tried to eliminate weakness. - I know, I know.

404
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,650
I tried to be you! I've passed every test,

405
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,420
and I've learned every lesson and I'm not enough!

406
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,380
I never said that.

407
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm a disappointment.

408
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,690
You said that, Mom.

409
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,040
And after everything that you've done to me,

410
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,350
I've kept trying,

411
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,490
because all I've ever wanted to do is please you.

412
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,460
Ruby...

413
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,350
You're my one weakness, Mom.

414
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,570
Ruby...

415
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,560
And I'm yours.

416
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,690
Ruby, stop.

417
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,160
I'll make you proud.

418
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,920
Get that ready for transport -- now.

419
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,290
How'd it go?

420
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,130
We're free and clear.

421
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,140
Daisy.

422
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,030
General. It's okay. It's okay.

423
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,710
Sorry. You startled me.

424
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,970
It's bad enough I look like a bottle brush.

425
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,180
Yeah, well, you probably can't look at me

426
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,360
without remembering... what happened.

427
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,110
Not always in the driver seat.

428
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,640
I know you didn't try and kill me.

429
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,030
I know that was a skin-job.

430
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,210
Still, I'm -- I'm really sorry.

431
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,000
I should apologize to you.

432
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,930
You came on a rescue mission to try and save me.

433
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,460
It went south. No, it's too high of a risk.

434
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,690
You should never have brought me here.

435
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,120
It's -- it's okay, General.

436
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,250
Um I brought you a change of clothes.

437
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,640
Is there anything else you need?

438
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,670
Thank you.

439
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,100
I'd like to talk to my wife.

440
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,100
You know, just to tell her I'm safe.

441
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,390
Hale is still looking for us.

443
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,930
We -- We can't have any contact with the outside world.

444
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,910
We have to stay dark.

445
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,860
I said cat -- cat!

446
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,680
I scared George, and...

447
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,990
I need to talk to my son.

448
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,460
I need him to know I haven't forgotten him.

449
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm sure he knows how much you love him.

450
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,500
I abandoned him, Agent Johnson!

451
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,810
You don't get a second chance to fix a screw-up like that.

452
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,730
Maybe I can get word to them through a secure channel.

453
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,790
That's all I'm asking for.

454
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,400
But that's not why you're here, is it.

455
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
We're trying to figure out our next move.

456
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,170
I need you to tell me what you can

457
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,340
about the site Hale kept you in and...

458
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,130
...I need you to tell me

459
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,840
everything you told her about us.

460
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,780
This could take a while.

461
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,120
Well, that didn't take long.

462
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,850
She won't work without this component.

463
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,880
And the machine does what, exactly?

464
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,980
An Adaptive Particle Processor.

465
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,890
Scans an element at the atomic level,

466
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,230
and then this component converts it

467
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,090
to be merged with the recipient's DNA.

468
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,070
We think it's the same technology

469
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,610
that gave Carl Creel his powers,

470
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,630
only his abilities are temporary and require physical touch.

471
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,080
Yeah, but the machine's been upgraded,

472
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,630
so if Hale were to use Gravitonium --

473
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,100
Yeah, yeah, I get it. No gizmo, no apocalypse.

474
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,220
But there's always a chance that we've tried this before.

475
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,540
More than a chance.

476
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,540
Previous selves probably came here,

477
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,190
made all the same decisions,

478
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,290
still failed to change the timeline.

479
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,720
You spoke to your older self in the future.

480
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,070
Did she give you any clues,

481
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,620
any specific ways to stop this all from happening again?

482
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,570
We didn't have much time.

483
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,520
I haven't told anyone this, not even Mack.

484
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,670
I didn't want to put this on the team.

485
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,130
What is it?

486
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,280
We have to let Coulson die.

487
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,280
What? That -- That doesn't make sense.

488
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,850
The other me, she said...

489
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,160
trying to save him is what led to the end.

490
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,090
But...how --

491
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,930
Time to improvise an exit strategy.

492
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,610
You guys open one of the doors, whoosh, whoosh,

493
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,720
I take their guns, ‭

494
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,520
we shoot the robots, we go home.

495
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,190
Sounds brilliant to me.

496
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,940
Mack is going to be sad to miss this.

497
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,130
Yo-Yo. Yo-Yo, what's going on?

498
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,410
Is that furrowed brow about our patient or about Yo-Yo?

499
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,910
One minute, I'm... terrified for her,

500
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,260
and the next minute, I'm furious with her.

501
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,880
Elena's always been stubborn, but ever since her arms...

502
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,630
Yeah, well, if I hadn't let Hale --

503
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,790
No, don't do that.

504
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,960
- You made a mistake. -Yeah, a big mistake.

505
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,860
Like, how do you even begin to make up for something like that?

506
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,000
...you fix something else.

507
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,820
That's why I like engines, putting the pieces together --

508
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

509
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,320
Piper, what do we do?

510
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,030
Uh, we have to find the source of the bleeding.

511
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,180
All right, the bullet's in there.

512
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,600
Must've nicked an artery.

513
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,080
All right, step two.

514
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,100
You have to clamp the artery

515
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,900
before his blood pressure drops any more.

516
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,060
Did not think ‭I'd be doing this today.

517
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,290
Damn it, stay still.

518
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,710
We're trying to help you.

519
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,690
He's stablised.

520
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,800
That's step two.

521
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,900
Yeah. Well, we're gonna have to wait to high-five.

522
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,430
Step three is, you sew his artery shut

523
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,860
so he doesn't bleed out and die.

524
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,670
- We need a new plan. - What happened out there?

525
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,050
I don't know. I was using my speed,

526
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,300
and it felt like my arms were being ripped off.

527
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,240
The mech arms aren't built to go that fast.

528
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,490
The interface is transmitting

529
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,150
every electrical signal simultaneously.

530
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,010
It's overloading your nervous system.

531
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,260
I don't need an explanation! I need a solution!

532
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,460
I can't recalibrate them,

533
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,600
not here, not before that door gives out.

534
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,610
Take cover there.

535
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,720
Fitz and I will draw them away from the exits,

536
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,810
keep them occupied.

537
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,920
You find a way out,

538
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,980
make it to the Quinjet, call for backup.

539
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
I can fight. ‭I think one of you should --

540
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,200
No. We have a rule.

541
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,180
We never leave ‭each other's side anymore.

542
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,950
Duck.

543
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,380
I'm sorry you never got the honeymoon you dreamed of.

544
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,310
Nonsense.

545
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,180
I'm protecting England from evil robots with the man I love.

546
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,750
Oh, it's jammed!

547
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,290
Go back, go back!

548
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,430
Running low.

549
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,970
I don't know what we were thinking.

550
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,720
There you are.

551
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,370
Please tell me you still believe time can't be changed.

552
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,700
You want to debate that now? Isn't --

553
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,140
Isn't that why we're here?

554
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,450
No, Fitz, just tell me it's against the law of physics.

555
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,770
I need that right now.

556
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,810
- The perception of time is an illusion. - Last mag.

557
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,260
According to Hermann Minkowski, space-time --

558
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,420
No, you know, I was wrong. It's not helping.

559
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,950
I heard what happened to you.

560
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,830
Now you are also part machine.

561
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,540
Not the part that matters.

562
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,030
I no longer feel pain.

563
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,460
Unlike you.

564
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,870
I have died dozens of times.

565
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,900
But you, no second chances.

566
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,230
Part machine.

567
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,150
Who's superior now?

568
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,470
He was controlling them.

569
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,960
- Welcome back. - You are on a lot of drugs.

570
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,190
But, hey, good news -- you didn't die.

571
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,950
Thank you.

572
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,900
You guys saved me.

573
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,660
Well, we're just glad you pulled through.

574
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,400
Is Daisy here?

575
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,670
She's so pretty.

576
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,280
What now?

577
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,890
I want to put my mouth on her mouth and move it around a lot.

578
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,700
But I don't want to do that unless she wants to, too,

579
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,520
'cause that's what makes it nice.

580
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,900
But I don't think she wants that,

581
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,570
'cause she does not like me one bit.

582
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,230
I mean, she's -- she's not my type,

583
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,700
but I -- I get it.

584
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,720
Okay, Spaceman, maybe we should --

585
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,810
Ma-a-a-a-a-ck!

586
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,220
Dude!

587
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,010
You are so cool.

588
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,890
Do we know any handshakes?

589
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,490
Uh, I appreciate that, but --

590
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,180
Should I shave my head?

591
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,050
Yeah, no, I see no flaws in that plan.

592
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,920
Maybe then Daisy would like me, because she -- she protected me.

593
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,130
She's very smart.

594
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,510
Would it hurt him if I turn this up?

595
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,070
- Yeah, I don't think so. - Good.

596
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,100
I also -- Ooh. My brain is falling --

597
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,360
Hey, something weird just happened.

598
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,740
I-I wouldn't.

599
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,400
Uh, remember the signal transceivers from the mechs?

600
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,480
Yeah.

601
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,550
We got a ping.

602
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,180
We're tracing it.

603
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,770
They're not damaged. They just went offline.

604
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,780
Perhaps something Yo-Yo did?

605
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,610
Yeah.

606
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,520
Whatever it is, we're safe...for now.

607
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,440
Still can't believe we survived.

608
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,130
Me neither.

609
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,150
But you were so certain we'd be fine.

610
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,900
"Time is fixed" And all that.

611
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,600
I started having my doubts.

612
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,020
Maybe your hopeful nature's rubbing off on me.

613
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,900
Aww, how cute.

614
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,100
Well, looks like you two have made quite the mess.

615
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,360
It's not the first time.

616
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,210
They were there when S.H.I.E.L.D. tortured me.

617
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,800
No.

618
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,210
They destroyed a component for the infuser.

619
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,320
It's useless.

620
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,950
We can't transfer the Gravitonium until it's repaired.

621
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,720
Fix it.

622
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,070
Or bleed out.

623
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,130
Fitz, we can't let it happen again.

624
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,870
We don't have a choice.

625
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,050
We never did.

626
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,500
We'll return in a moment.

627
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,870
I thought you'd like to know that we got a lead on Hale.

628
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,070
You really helped.

629
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,220
I wouldn't go that far.

630
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,230
I also thought about what you said about your son.

631
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,330
And, um...if -- if I would've known

632
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,100
that my dad cared growing up,

633
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,040
it would've made a big difference.

634
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,680
Um, so, it took some doing,

635
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,460
uh, but this phone was set to bounce

636
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,060
through a dozen foreign relays.

637
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,150
We only have one shot, and even then, just a few minutes.

638
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:53,060
But you can call them, without Hale tracing us.

639
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,790
Thank you.

640
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:08,870
Hello?

641
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,260
Hi, honey. It's Glenn.

642
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,680
Oh, Glenn.

643
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,930
I was so worried.

644
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,150
I know. I'm -- I'm so sorry.

645
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,510
Once the Air Force took you, I-I got a few progress reports,

646
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,970
but then you never called.

647
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,980
I thought I'd never see you again.

648
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,500
Honey, I'm sorry. I only have a few minutes.

649
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,190
I-I just want you to tell George that his dad's okay

650
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,290
and his father loves him very much.

651
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,620
And I'm getting better.

652
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm getting stronger, and I'm...

653
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,150
I'm not yelling...as much.

654
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,180
- Glenn... - Yeah?

655
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,410
The doctors said you should take a deep breath.

656
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,330
Calm your mind.

657
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,540
You know what is best.

658
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,940
What is best is you comply.

659
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,480
Remember, your compliance will be rewarded.

660
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,350
Glenn, are you ready to comply?

661
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm happy to.
