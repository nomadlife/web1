1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,790
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,280
Daisy's powers are the missing key

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,880
manipulating e Gravitonium.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,970
I wouldn't have done any of this

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,610
if I didn't believe it was going to work.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,900
I'll never forgive you.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,500
You had a psychic split.

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,860
But that dark persona, that's not you.

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,850
I really don't know where we go from here.

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,660
You're standing next to the man responsible for shooting Talbot.

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,110
Daisy Johnson shot Talbot.

12
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,300
That was an android.

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,380
Come with me.

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,020
Let me show you what we are really up against.

15
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,280
My vantage point is much higher than yours.

16
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,270
I come with you, my people get away unharmed.

17
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,600
I can agree to that.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,850
I see they've shown you to your new accommodations.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,430
Of all the blindfolds I've forcibly worn,

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,140
that was one of the nicest.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,350
There's a method to this madness.

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,140
All of your questions will be answered in the morning.

23
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,000
Not my first rodeo, so I may have already figured out

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,760
a little bit of what's going on here.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,610
You've got the Gravitonium

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,840
and the total disregard for human safety.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,970
Check.

28
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,490
You've got Ivan Drago and Crusher Creel on the payroll.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,610
Check.

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,950
And then there's you, rogue general,

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,950
operating with zero oversight.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,300
Add it all up,

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,860
it just doesn't feel like an Air Force operation.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,400
It's not.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,790
It's Hydra.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,590
I thought we stomped you out.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,020
Yes.

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,390
Just as you were stomped out.

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,930
And yet here we are in the same room.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,340
I'd like to tell you my story,

41
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,980
and I think you'll know it's time.

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,400
Time for what?

43
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,990
It's time for S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra to finally unite.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,130
Good morning.

45
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,540
Rise and seize the future.

46
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,730
One more day. Are you excited?

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,750
Excited to be done with these lectures.

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,560
Can't stand another one of these old dudes

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,270
droning on about placement.

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,350
Well, at least today's guest speaker is cool.

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,980
You know, I heard ‭that he once used alien DNA

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,560
to actually reverse the body's aging process.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,880
Oh, shut up, Sitwell.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,980
You're just jealous.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,700
Of you being a teacher's pet?

56
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,790
They've got you better trained than any of our mutts.

57
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,870
You're jealous ‭because I am going places

58
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,010
while you will be stuck in middle management.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,380
Calm down.

60
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,420
Take a seat.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,370
I know everyone is excited about graduation tomorrow.

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,220
As a reminder, there will be a final examination tonight.

63
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,200
And now, here to speak to you

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
about another post-grad opportunity,

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,100
please welcome Daniel Whitehall.

66
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,070
Good morning.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,790
It's an honor to speak with you,

68
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,000
the future of our organization.

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,550
Tomorrow, you will leave these halls

70
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,620
and venture out into society.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,930
And though you may be behind the scenes,

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,540
there are many ways that you can help Hydra

73
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,450
dismantle the oppressive state.

74
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,030
Since World War II and the success of Steve Rogers,

75
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,970
there have been many failed attempts

76
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,390
to create a super soldier.

77
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,960
But after some ungainly setbacks...

78
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,760
we're close --

79
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,180
close to creating the most powerful man on Earth.

80
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,350
Now, this is the particle infusion chamber,

81
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,380
an apparatus that can force human cells

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,760
to take on the properties of a raw material.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,690
Imagine...

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,860
a man with the density of lead, with the volatility of cesium.

85
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,500
The possibilities are endless.

86
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,410
Can someone name another substance suitable for infusion?

87
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,670
Yes, Mr. Von Strucker.

88
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,270
Why not use Red Skull's Tesseract?

89
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
It's the greatest power source we've ever had.

90
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,360
Intriguing.

91
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,920
Looking to our past for inspiration.

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,100
That's a waste of time.

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
There's no way that we could take it from S.H.I.E.L.D. unnoticed.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
We would blow our cover.

95
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,470
Well, I suppose you have a better substance in mind?

96
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,260
We're not gonna find it by digging up our history.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,670
Instead, we should look to where the Tesseract came from

98
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,000
to find new materials.

99
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,320
Meaning?

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,770
Outer space.

101
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,680
Finally!

102
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,050
Some forward thinking.

103
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,480
You're going to S.H.I.E.L.D.,

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,310
admin division.

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,040
I-Isn't that what you wanted?

106
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,470
You okay?

107
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,480
That test was tough for everyone.

108
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,410
I'm fine.

109
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,430
Hear about your placement yet?

110
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,670
Nothing.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,770
Getting anxious.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,630
Well, I would be, too.

113
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,490
Especially if I picked a fight with Strucker.

114
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,690
You know that he put those two up to that.

115
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,770
Doesn't matter.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,730
You punched the future leader of Hydra in the face.

117
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,480
You screwed your chances of getting a good placement, genius.

118
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,430
Ms. Hale.

119
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,900
Daniel Whitehall ‭would like a word with you.

120
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,490
You've made quite the impression lately.

121
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,390
Seems you're one of the few females to make it to commencement.

122
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,550
It's a tough school.

123
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,440
And you completed your final test?

124
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,110
Well-done.

125
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,320
It's a rite of passage.

126
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,350
You must eliminate any weakness,

127
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,680
no matter how difficult.

128
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,440
I imagine it wasn't easy to sleep last night.

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,000
Not with all the boys sobbing through the walls.

130
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,890
Leadership expected nothing less.

131
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,580
In fact, we're confident

132
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,490
we see the future of Hydra in you.

133
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,630
That's why I've selected you for my program.

134
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,860
Sir. I'm honored.

135
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,420
I've dreamed of working with you,

136
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,240
and I really think that the chamber can revolution--

137
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,230
No, no, no.

138
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,560
Von Strucker will be working on the chamber.

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,480
I-is this because he and I got into a fight?

140
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,470
In a sense, yes.

141
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,210
We're actually impressed by your strength, your mettle.

142
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,160
We think ‭that you will be essential

143
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,560
in engineering the perfect human specimen for the chamber.

144
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,500
But... sir, I'm -- I'm not a biologist.

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,510
Correct, but you're the only candidate left with the other...

146
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,440
necessary qualifications.

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,430
You want me to be --

148
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,990
Artificially inseminated.

149
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,030
It's quite exciting, yes?

150
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,490
You should be honored.

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,250
You will give birth to our new leader.

152
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,200
As I said...

153
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,310
we see the future of Hydra in you.

154
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,240
What about my future?

155
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,300
As requested, you'll be placed

156
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,810
deep undercover ‭within the Air Force, perhaps...

157
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,830
you'll even become an astronaut.

158
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,050
However, once the seed has been perfected,

159
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,750
we expect you'll serve the cause.

160
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,600
Sir...

161
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm flattered...

162
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,030
but is there an option where I utilize my talents elsewhere?

163
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,670
You always have a choice whether or not to comply.

164
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,090
Hail Hydra.

165
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,810
That's what I thought.

166
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,160
Good morning.

167
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,620
Rise and seize the future.

168
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,300
Poor boys could never keep up.

169
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,170
Well, her weaknesses are more glaring than you think.

170
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,830
She doesn't look weak to me.

171
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,140
Any idea ‭what leadership has planned for her after graduation?

172
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,600
Oh, they have yet to decide.

173
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,190
What's to decide?

174
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,510
Whitehall designed her to lead.

175
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,800
Whitehall is dead.

176
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,950
So, does he know ‭where I'm gonna be assigned after graduation?

177
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,900
It's being discussed.

178
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,510
He knows ‭that you're top of the class.

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,320
Runs in the family.

180
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,820
You don't think they're gonna stick me somewhere boring

181
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,850
- like Air Force, do you? ‭- Hey, hold on.

182
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,720
I happen to think that Air Force is very good placement.

183
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,450
You get to see combat, flight training.

184
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,870
You could even become an astronaut.

185
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,060
That's why I joined.

186
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,660
An astronaut?

187
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,700
Why didn't you ever tell me?

188
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,220
That would've been so cool.

189
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,160
You would've been like 10 times cooler.

190
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,570
Maybe.

191
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,750
But I wouldn't have had you.

192
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Let me guess.

193
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,080
Your country calls.

194
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,930
Sorry, sweetie.

195
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,690
We've got a problem.

196
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,260
Is this an Air Force matter?

197
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,070
S.H.I.E.L.D. captured Gideon Malick.

198
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,040
Is he talking?

199
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,950
It's bad. We have to move fast.

200
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,590
Here.

201
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,390
I need you to take this,

202
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,430
locate the device ‭that's hidden in my vault,

203
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,760
find somewhere safe.

204
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,530
You're now ‭overseeing communications.

205
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,360
Fisher.

206
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,380
Fisher, what is this? Look at me!

207
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,820
What the hell is going on?

208
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,550
Okay, after New York, we found transceivers

209
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,700
in the wreckage ‭of one of the Chitauri cruisers.

210
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,160
We reached out. Someone answered.

211
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,220
You made contact with aliens.

212
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,140
It's an alliance of several races.

213
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,640
They call themselves the Confederacy.

214
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,570
Well, why the hell ‭wasn't I brought in on this?

215
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,410
General?

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,720
Gonna need you to come with me.

217
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,150
Come on, Hale.

218
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,300
Step away.

219
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,800
This is for your own safety.

220
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,720
Hail Hydra!

221
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,540
Get him!

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,870
Fool! Get him to medical now!

223
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,350
How could you let that happen?!

224
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,070
Now! Move!

225
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,030
I was looking forward to making that traitor talk.

226
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,640
You all right?

227
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,730
Yeah, fine. I just...

228
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,420
I thought we'd seen the last of Hydra.

229
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,630
Well, don't worry.

230
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,770
After today,

231
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,410
you'll never have to see one of those squids again.

232
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,690
I don't understand

233
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,490
what my dog has to do with me graduating.

234
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,760
Your attachment to that mutt is a liability.

235
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,060
You cannot serve until you complete the test.

236
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,590
I'm the only one left!

237
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,460
You're seriously gonna stop me from serving

238
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,560
because of some barbaric ritual?!

239
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,380
Do not question the Hydra way!

240
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,730
- You trust in the system! - Why not?!

241
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,850
Look where it's gotten us!

242
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,510
We're this close to being wiped out!

243
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,560
All the more reason to devote yourself now.

244
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,720
Eliminate your weakness.

245
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,100
Wake up!

246
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,710
Me obeying you -- that is weakness!

247
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,790
You, with your blind faith, with this stupid tradition --

248
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,990
that's weakness!

249
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,820
No!

250
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,420
It is a rite of passage to a life built on control and survival!

251
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,980
That's why, when you cut off the head,

252
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,530
two more spring up!

253
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
And now we're the last two.

254
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,260
General Talbot?

255
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,120
Your family's here to see you.

256
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,090
Okay.

257
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,680
Not a train, because the last one was a train.

258
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,670
Choo-choo. Choo-choo train.

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,560
Right? Uh...

260
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,850
Strawberry? It's not a strawberry.

261
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,740
It's a cat.

262
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,790
Nice job, Dad. You're on a roll.

263
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,350
Hey, we can do this,

264
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,300
because I got a mind like a steel trap.

265
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,760
We can get through this.

266
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,720
All right, so, last one's a train.

267
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,000
Wait. I don't understand.

268
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,290
He was getting better,

269
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,690
and now you want to transfer him somewhere...

270
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,400
More comprehensive.

271
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,980
But he's getting better. He's calm.

272
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,070
Today's a good day, Mrs. Talbot,

273
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,280
but the damage to his frontal lobe is severe.

274
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,900
It's gonna take a lot more time to retrain his brain

275
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,850
to control his impulses and think clearly.

276
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,110
No! No!

277
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,650
That's not a friggin' cat!

278
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,310
- That's not a cat! - Glenn, honey.

279
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,100
- Mom... - Honey, everything is okay.

280
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,750
George is just trying to help.

281
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,290
No, he showed me this -- this --

282
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,660
This is a tiger!

283
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,280
I said it was a cat, and he said it was right,

284
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,020
but I'm not right! I'm wrong!

285
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,640
How am I gonna get better if nobody's honest with me?!

286
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,000
Sir, take a moment and --

287
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,310
No, you take a moment! Stop it!

288
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,780
Stop pumping me full of that junk!

289
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,490
You s--

290
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,480
I...

291
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,830
I promise, we'll take very good care of him.

292
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,990
What in the Sam Hell...?

293
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,170
Hello?

294
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,740
Hello?!

295
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,030
Boy.

296
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,680
Stomach is so hungry, it's about to digest itself.

297
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,380
I still outrank you.

298
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,540
I don't know you.

299
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,280
I don't know you.

300
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,490
You want to tell me

301
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,060
what we're doing in this godforsaken place?

302
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,200
Don't you walk away from me, young lady!

303
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,940
I don't appreciate being ignored!

304
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,740
You answer me!

305
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,230
You answer me before I rip those sorry little headphones

306
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,630
from your sorry little --

307
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,690
I see you've met my daughter, Ruby.

308
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,100
Cross-fit Tinker Bell is your daughter?

309
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,440
I've known you 20 years.

310
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,080
You never once mentioned having a child.

311
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,370
I never felt it was anything

312
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,060
you should be concerned with.

313
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,890
General Hale, where the hell am I?

314
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,720
All in due time.

315
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,690
You don't speak to your commanding officer like that.

316
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,830
You don't speak to a superior --

317
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,990
You don't speak to a superior officer like that,

318
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,730
and as such,

319
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,230
I'm ordering you to tell me exactly what's going on!

320
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,280
Because I'm not gonna put up with one more second of this --

321
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,480
Your Air Force career is over.

322
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,900
Your family is afraid of you.

323
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,660
And your lack of impulse control

324
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,210
is a threat to yourself and others.

325
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,990
Why are you telling me this?

326
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,420
Because there was a time in my life

327
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,640
when I felt like everything was out of control

328
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,380
and I needed a new purpose,

329
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,810
and I see you going through the same ordeal.

330
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,290
I think you and I can help each other.

331
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,820
How?

332
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,190
Let me show you what I'm working on.

333
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,970
I don't know what the hell this is.

334
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,900
I don't think she knows what the hell this is.

335
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,750
What the hell is this thing?

336
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
What the -- What is this thing?

337
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,810
What is this contraption?

338
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,760
To be honest, I have no idea.

339
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,490
They use it to move ships through the galaxies.

340
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,150
Galaxies?

341
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,410
You're suggesting --

342
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,730
Just let me explain.

343
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,420
After New York, my predecessors made contact

344
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,460
with life beyond the solar system.

345
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,530
They gave us this

346
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,450
to travel to the stars and meet with them.

347
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,890
Face to face.

348
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,010
I learned my predecessors hadn't just made contact.

349
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,490
They had struck a deal for protection.

350
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,210
From what?

351
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,290
The war coming to Earth.

352
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,910
It's only a matter of time before it reaches us.

353
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,500
This one's nuttier than a Butterfinger.

354
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,320
She just said what? War?

355
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,520
Why didn't this make it up through the chain of command?

356
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,300
How come it didn't get to me?

357
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,850
It's not Air Force, Glenn.

358
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,440
Then how did you get the project?

359
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,280
From General Fischer.

360
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,050
The day that he killed himself.

361
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,370
What flag do you fly, General Hale?

362
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,110
I think that's irrelevant when you're fighting a common enemy.

363
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,590
What flag...

364
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,470
do you fly?

365
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,610
Does it matter?

366
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,170
If you choose those squid billies,

367
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,670
it matters.

368
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,370
I didn't choose Hydra.

369
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,910
I was born into it.

370
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,980
Just like you were born and raised and indoctrinated

371
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,220
under the Stars and Stripes.

372
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,450
Indoctrinated? No. I wasn't.

373
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,360
I am not some wing nut,

374
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,210
and I stand by my red, white, and blue.

375
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,000
No. You stand by a country founded in oppression.

376
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,090
You stand by an eagle on a S.H.I.E.L.D.

377
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,450
even after you saw Daisy Johnson shot you in the head,

378
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,240
- point-blank. - That wasn't Daisy!

379
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,050
I know you think I've lost my onions,

380
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,400
but I've got a feeling it was one of Anton Ivanov's tin cans.

381
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,910
Am I wrong?

382
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,210
No, you're right. That was an LMD.

383
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,860
But it was created by S.H.I.E.L.D.,

384
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
and it was used on you.

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,190
Don't you see these symbols are irrelevant?

386
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,970
We are humans fighting for our survival.

387
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,220
We need every weapon we can get in this fight,

388
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,120
which is why I need you.

389
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,960
You filthy calamari Mata Hari.

390
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,380
Weapon?

391
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,850
What kind of weapon, exactly?

392
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,640
It's an old Hydra device.

393
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,370
I'm starting to understand why I might be here.

394
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,730
But you're not gonna get it from me.

395
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,310
'Cause I have a mind like a steel trap.

396
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,680
That's right.

397
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,210
I'm the one that hid the Hydra contraband.

398
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,940
And you want to know something else?

399
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,330
I'm not talking.

400
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,040
You got to let go of these old symbols.

401
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,200
You need to let go of the old Talbot.

402
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,320
I am giving you new purpose.

403
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,090
Help me save humanity.

404
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,620
I would rather die on my two legs

405
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,870
than slither on eight with you.

406
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,210
Actually, squids don't have legs.

407
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,580
They have tentacles.

408
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,160
They're cephalopods.

409
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,910
Let me out of here.

410
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,580
I swear, I will bust your kraken ass!

411
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,240
Let's try this conversation again

412
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,060
when you're feeling more reasonable.

413
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,620
You can't do this!

414
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,600
You let me out!

415
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,030
I'll never talk! You won't break me!

416
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,730
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s going to be coming through that door any day now!

417
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,990
You just wait and see!

418
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,150
Phil Coulson's coming for me!

419
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,010
Hello?

420
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,140
Is this supposed to keep me off-balance or something,

421
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,260
having me stumble out

422
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,750
to an Econo Lodge continental breakfast?

423
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,070
I give this place a C-minus.

424
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,350
Wait a minute.

425
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,760
"Oops! All Berries."

426
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,450
Okay. C-plus.

427
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,540
By the way, when Hale's done playing games,

428
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,610
I'll be in my room.

429
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,980
That girl, the member of your team I haven't met yet,

430
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,260
is she the one responsible for cutting my agent's arms off?

431
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,810
That's my daughter, Ruby.

432
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,680
Seems like a major strike against homeschooling.

433
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,890
She's not exactly helping your sales pitch

434
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,000
on the merits of teaming up with Hydra.

435
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,170
You're right.

436
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,500
Why don't you let me show you what I'm working on?

437
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
Bad idea.

438
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,080
You don't even know what it does.

439
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,280
I don't need to.

440
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,340
It's got that weird alien writing on the side.

441
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,040
Longitude.

442
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,000
Latitude.

443
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,160
And altitude.

444
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,000
You need to elevate your vantage point.

445
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,300
Would you grab that handle, please?

446
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,180
I'm good.

447
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,290
I've already been to space.

448
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,950
Pretty recently, actually.

449
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,900
No, you need to meet him for yourself.

450
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,730
Or what?

451
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,070
Why have you brought this human uninvited?

452
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,590
This is Phil Coulson.

453
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,450
He considers himself humanity's shield,

454
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,990
one of Earth's mightiest heroes.

455
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,890
Her words, not mine.

456
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,990
He's that ally that we need.

457
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,890
I'm hoping that you can show him the wisdom

458
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,710
of helping the Confederacy.

459
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,270
Very well.

460
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,700
Your world will soon become a battleground.

461
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,780
We will ensure humanity's survival.

462
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,010
For a price?

463
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,130
Much smaller than you'll pay if this comes to Earth.

464
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,680
So, the shadow guy will save humanity

465
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,590
from the alien warships.

466
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,590
Provided we meet certain terms.

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,220
Let me guess -- Gravitonium.

468
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,820
Amongst other things.

469
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,820
And Inhumans,

470
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,930
or engineered warriors, as they call them.

471
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,340
That's why you need me.

472
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,780
Yes.

473
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,130
You know where they are and how to contact them.

474
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,890
So you want my help to arm alien warlords.

475
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,980
You ever consider

476
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,570
they may not hold up their end of the bargain?

477
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,350
That maybe something called the Confederacy

478
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,730
will just enslave us all?

479
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
The thought has occurred to me.

480
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,310
Then, why cooperate with them? We need to fight back.

481
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,290
Finally, someone who gets it.

482
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,360
Altering the deal has always been my goal.

483
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,770
Now you see why we have to stop fighting each other.

484
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,170
And work together.

485
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,740
Right now, the Confederacy thinks

486
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,480
that we have no choice but to cooperate.

487
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,200
And you wanna prove we're not so easily coerced.

488
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,220
Not only that, but that we're a galactic superpower

489
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,600
not to be toyed with.

490
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,810
That's gonna require a significant display of force.

491
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,480
The whole "we will not go quietly into the night" bit.

492
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,560
What's your plan?

493
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,290
You're familiar with Dr. Whitehall?

494
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,160
I buried him.

495
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,130
Go, team.

496
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,460
We've been searching for an old Whitehall program.

497
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,220
It's a particle-infusion chamber.

498
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,520
It's designed to create the most powerful man.

499
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,620
Like Captain America.

500
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,810
Better than that.

501
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,590
Personally, I'd like to see the most powerful human

502
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,960
not be a man.

503
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,450
If the idea is to put your ninja daughter into that chamber,

504
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,270
this is gonna be a long conversation.

505
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,880
Cap was selected for his heart,

506
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,470
not cutting off hands.

507
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,400
Ruby is a perfect fit.

508
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,840
Her physical biometrics were optimized for particle infusion.

509
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,550
I'm sensing a "But."

510
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
She's not ready.

511
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm not sure she has the temperament.

512
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm wondering if your Daisy Johnson is a better fit.

513
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,140
You've made her into quite the formidable soldier.

514
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,760
"Made" is not the term I would use.

515
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,530
Well, as far as her heart is concerned,

516
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,310
I hear she sacrificed her own boyfriend

517
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,340
for the greater good.

518
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,030
Those decisions are not easily made.

519
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,000
- Now wait a minute - Look, she's powerful, she's intelligent,

520
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,130
she's calculating.

521
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,390
If the Confederacy needs Gravitonium...

522
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,170
Daisy Johnson is the one to deliver it.

523
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,830
By infusing her with Gravitonium?

524
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,090
Yes, she would have the power to level alien armies,

525
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,610
blow their ships apart.

526
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,710
She would be worthy of Whitehall's code name for the project --

527
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,830
Destroyer of Worlds.

528
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,530
Obviously, the guy was overcompensating for something,

529
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,230
- but - ‭No. No, stop.

530
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,780
This is a huge mistake --

531
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
a broken-planet-sized mistake.

532
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,210
Listen, my team wasn't hiding all these months.

533
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,800
We traveled to the future.

534
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,440
We saw the aftermath of that program.

535
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,600
You traveled to the future?

536
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,790
And back.

537
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,180
I saw the Earth cracked apart,

538
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,940
but not because of the Confederacy

539
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,290
or that alien ship.

540
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,880
It was because of my actions.

541
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,010
Exactly. Call off the search.

542
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,390
Do not let anyone enter that chamber.

543
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,160
Let me ask you something.

544
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,750
In this fever dream of yours,

545
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,290
are you the big, strong man

546
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,560
who's saving me from my mistakes?

547
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,200
- It's more complicated than that. You just - I'm sure it is.

548
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,700
I can't tell if you're delusional

549
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,330
or playing games with me.

550
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,260
This is very disappointing.

551
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,040
I thought you, of all people,

552
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,620
could see the bigger picture.

553
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,320
Clearly, you're just like the rest of them.

554
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I listened to you! ‭Now listen to me, General!

555
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,670
I've heard enough.

556
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,390
Let's try this conversation again

557
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,950
when you're feeling more reasonable.

558
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,520
You're making a huge mistake!

559
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,500
No!

560
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,310
You have to listen to me!

561
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,150
It's cool.

562
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,960
Did you actually...

563
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,610
travel to the future?

564
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,710
'Cause my mom doesn't believe that.

565
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,830
Well-aware how crazy it sounds.

566
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,470
So, if you really did see the future, then...

567
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,270
tell me how I fail.

568
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,070
What do you mean?

569
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,910
You told my mom ‭that the Destroyer of Worlds

570
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,310
cracks the planet apart, so...

571
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,310
what did I do wrong?

572
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,590
I hate to burst ‭your apocalyptic bubble,

573
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,270
but it wasn't you.

574
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,510
Daisy Johnson.

575
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,420
Where is she?

576
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,430
That's a bad idea, Ruby.

577
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,840
You can't beat her.

578
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,310
Yes, I can.

579
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,000
Where is she?

580
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,070
I can't tell you.

581
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,580
But I can recommend some medication,

582
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,860
preferably at a high dosage.

583
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,960
Other than that, I'm not talking.

584
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,480
Why don't I show you how that worked out

585
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,340
for the last guy who said that to me.

586
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,320
Stay quiet.

587
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,420
Stay quiet.

588
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't even make a sound. She'll --

589
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,670
Talbot.

590
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
What happened?

591
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,890
Phil?

592
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,900
‭I told them you would come.

593
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,310
I tried to hold out.

594
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,130
S.H.I.E.L.D. never came.

595
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm sorry, Phil. I told them everything.

596
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,780
I held out as long as I could, but S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't show up.

597
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,790
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,460
Phil, Phil, it's --

599
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:15,930
Phil!

600
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,470
I'm sorry, Coulson! I'm sorry!

601
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,000
Daisy.

602
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,430
Daisy? Did you hear me?

603
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,750
Yeah, I heard you. I'm just thinking it through.

604
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,130
Strucker's escape, Anton, Creel...

605
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,010
And her connection to General Fischer.

606
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,430
Hale is Hydra.

607
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,550
Hale Hydra.

608
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,510
Seriously?

609
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,390
How are we still fighting Nazis today?

610
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,150
More importantly, ‭why does she need Coulson?

611
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,890
Okay. I don't even know where to start.

612
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,820
Obviously, ‭we have to get ahead of her,

613
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,620
but we have no leads,

614
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,040
because everyone in Hydra's locked up,

615
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,010
but we can't question them without false documents,

616
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,820
which I can't get without more resources.

617
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,940
So there's no -- ‭Hey.

618
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,360
Coulson chose you for a reason.

619
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,760
Take a breath.

620
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,420
This is just another fight.

621
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,940
No, it's not. I can't quake this away.

622
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,270
Remember combat training.

623
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,770
Take what you have,

624
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,390
use it to your advantage.

625
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,170
We have nothing.

626
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,970
We have a super villain.

627
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,790
Go on. Let's get it over with.

628
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,880
Tell her ‭I can't be trusted anymore.

629
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,520
You forget that I was Hydra in the Framework, too.

630
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,900
I know how this works.

631
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,410
I made decisions I regret.

632
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,460
This isn't the Framework.

633
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,940
And, truthfully...

634
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,360
...I don't regret it.

635
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,180
Just how it had to be done.

636
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,770
Well...

637
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,760
I'm not asking you to apologize for it.

638
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,360
I'm asking you to embrace it.

639
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,500
Okay.

640
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,230
Just need to calibrate the myoelectric interface.

641
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,980
Wouldn't want her suffering any neural distortion.

642
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,660
No disrespect, ‭but you sure you got this,

643
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,750
or do you need to consult Fitz?

644
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,070
No need.

645
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,750
Listen, I know you went into the Framework, but...

646
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,820
for those of us who were really plugged in, it was...

647
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,020
Well, it's hard to explain.

648
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,730
It...

649
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,170
It's you, but it's not you.

650
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,830
Look, I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm saying this all wrong.

651
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,080
- I understand. - ‭No, ‭what I mean is that,

652
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,490
it's not that Fitz ‭is still a bad guy out here.

653
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,250
It's that he was still a good guy in there.

654
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,780
Somehow.

655
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,830
I understand.

656
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,040
And thank you.

657
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,660
Okay.

658
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,940
Moment of truth.

659
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,680
So, when Yo-Yo wakes up,

660
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,230
she's gonna be stronger than before?

661
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,930
Theoretically.

662
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,620
Is something wrong?

663
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,630
Just that, lately,

664
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,790
she's been acting like she's bulletproof,

665
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,380
like nothing can stop her.

666
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,620
Well, that is not an uncommon attitude for our team.

667
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,840
No, this is different.

668
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,730
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse,

669
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,390
so now she knows for a fact

670
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,270
that she lives far into the future.

671
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,410
So, if Yo-Yo subscribes to Fitz's theory

672
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,920
that time can't be changed, then --

673
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,450
She thinks she can't be killed.

674
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,370
Interesting.

675
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,670
What's your conclusion?

676
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,960
Well, we know that Hale went after Gravitonium,

677
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,970
so unless she's experimenting with artificial gravity,

678
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,350
I think ‭she's trying to build a weapon.

679
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,910
But why does Hale want Coulson?

680
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,060
I don't know.

681
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,440
If we can determine Hale's target,

682
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,300
then we can infer Coulson's role.

683
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,990
We have a lot of intel on file.

684
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,850
I just need a few hours' access

685
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,660
to the computers and the labs.

686
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,040
I can figure it out.

687
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,060
I can't help ‭when I'm locked up in this cell.

688
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,480
Not a chance.

689
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,000
I suspected you were listening.

690
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,820
Yeah, and, of course, your solution involves us letting you out.

691
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,860
- I'm only ‭trying to help, Daisy. - He's still on our side.

692
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,450
Don't defend him, not to me.

693
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,250
There's not a lot of team left here,

694
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,640
so let's hold it together.

695
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,180
We had to seal the rift shut.

696
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,200
By any means, no matter how sadistic.

697
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,180
- Okay. Well, would you have agreed to do it? - ‭Never.

698
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Well, then, I didn't have a choice.

699
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,730
You didn't have a choice?

700
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,090
You drugged me, you restrained me,

701
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,680
and you cut into me.

702
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,960
I don't feel good about it, either,

703
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,670
but in a few hours,

704
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,270
the town up there would've been affected, as well,

705
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,700
so... I'm sorry.

706
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,240
I don't need your forgiveness.

707
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,610
I just need you to trust me.

708
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,530
You are not leaving this room.

709
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,780
You are Hydra.

710
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,430
Well, that's an advantage.

711
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,400
I salute the same flag as those people.

712
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,040
Yeah, but we don't turn on our own here.

713
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,520
Do you want me to recount all the times that you did?

714
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,030
We'll figure out another way to track Hale down.

715
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,750
- We've done it before. - And it was a trap.

716
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,830
It'll be different this time.

717
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,750
Yeah, 'cause you've got powers back,

718
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,200
and they've got the Gravitonium.

719
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,540
We already sealed one crack in the Earth.

720
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,630
It doesn't take a fortune teller

721
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,600
to see how easy it would be to make another one.

722
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,390
Are you listening to me?

723
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,380
Daisy!

724
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,980
Daisy, where are you going?

725
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,450
He's right.

726
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,840
It might not take a fortune teller,

727
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,550
but why not ask one anyway?

728
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,350
You want to bring Robin out of hiding

729
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,760
and risk her getting hurt?

730
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,830
Daisy...

731
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,340
Our leader is missing. We have to get him back.

732
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,400
We need every weapon we can get in this fight.

733
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,530
We'll return in a moment.

734
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,720
Again, I can't do anything

735
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,710
while I'm locked away in this dungeon.

736
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,870
Like a...

737
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,150
hideous, freckled stepchild.

738
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,040
Please.

739
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,070
You're not ‭in the least bit hideous.

740
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,690
Take it you and Daisy had a productive chat.

741
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,700
She quaked me against the wall and then stormed out,

742
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,680
so, yeah, ‭it was quite productive.

743
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,190
You've got that look.

744
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,920
I've been thinking about you and me --

745
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,010
about us.

746
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,180
Jemma.

747
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,410
Relax.

748
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,130
I know we get through this.

749
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,140
Do you recognize this?

750
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,790
Yeah. It's mine.

751
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,870
After my injury, I got the number engraved

752
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,340
because I couldn't remember the name.

753
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,180
See, that's the thing.

754
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,850
This one's yours.

755
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,030
That other tool belongs to Deke...

756
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,430
...who got it from his grandfather.

757
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,700
He's my...

758
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,820
...our...

759
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,250
...grandson?

760
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,250
Yeah.

761
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,320
But...

762
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,550
he's the worst.

763
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,600
I think he's perfect.

764
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,150
Plus, his very existence proves that

765
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,270
you and I make it to the Lighthouse...

766
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,910
and live long enough to raise a daughter.

767
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,240
Do you see what this means?

768
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,070
Yeah, I do.

769
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,830
It means that our daughter's obviously gonna marry

770
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,490
some belligerent space goon

771
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,030
if she's gonna give birth to a Deke.

772
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,700
No, Fitz.

773
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,150
It means you and I are invincible.
