1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,340
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,850
What I was in the Framework...

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,900
wasn't programming.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,600
Every light needs a shadow.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
You just have to learn how to control it.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,270
Mom?

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,500
The steps you take don't need to be big.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,610
They just need to take you in the right direction.

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,890
You always used to say that.

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,340
My mom said it to me.

11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,310
The steps you take don't need to be big.

12
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,560
They just need to take you in the right direction.

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,920
When the monoliths exploded,

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,970
they tore open a fear dimension.

15
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,620
It's our fears come to life.

16
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,650
The Gravitonium device that we used

17
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,460
to seal the rift is barely strong enough.

18
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,700
So, we need more Gravitonium

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,850
to seal the rift for good.

20
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,410
If you can box it up without touching it,

21
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,090
you might be able to get it off the ship.

22
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,740
One ball of Gravitonium.

23
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,370
Thank you.

24
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,450
Guess what I got you.

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,050
Arms.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,880
I want Hobnobs.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,950
I can search the stock for biscuits.

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,320
No. No. I want the real thing.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
I want proper British junk food.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,710
I want Maltesers, and I want Twiglets!

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,700
Remember when care packages were the only way

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,720
you could get through cramming at the Academy?

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,410
Yep, but those were problems we could actually solve.

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,650
The Gravitonium needs to be compressed to work with this.

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,620
I've no idea how to do that.

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,830
I don't know how...

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,180
Why'd it have to be a fear dimension coming to life?

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,730
Why couldn't it be dreams or wishes?

39
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,240
What would your wish be?

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,250
An extra day between Saturday and Sunday.

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,820
You?

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,060
Speak any language.

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
Or a honeymoon.

44
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,650
Uh, uh, can you grab me the crimpers?

45
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,080
Yeah.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Now, if we had more than one wish,

47
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,280
flying wouldn't be bad.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,090
Or a pony.

49
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,570
Or a flying pony --

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,140
Jemma!

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,750
Good.

52
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,270
That's good, but don't push yourself.

53
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,750
If I'm not pushing myself,

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,550
then what's the point of this test?

55
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,630
Crank it up.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,110
Let's see what I can do.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Right now, you're at 10 percent feedback to your nerves.

58
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,840
If just this level's causing you that much pain,

59
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,310
then maybe you should...

60
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,770
‭Okay.

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,910
I think that's enough for today.

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,210
This arm is just a prototype.

63
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,530
Fitz and I only had so much to work with

64
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,820
from the salvaged clangers we brought back,

65
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,160
but we'll figure something out.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
In the meantime,

67
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,900
I'll get these diagnostics to Fitz,

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,410
and then, uh, maybe we could add some additional --

69
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't need any bells and whistles, Mack.

70
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,920
I just need to be able to punch things.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,630
Your arms aren't fully healed yet.

72
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,740
What you need is time.

73
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,960
My arms may not work, but my eyes do.

74
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,990
At least let me sit in Control, keep an eye out for anomalies.

75
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,930
Maybe,

76
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,960
but you have to allow yourself to heal.

77
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,700
We'll handle the fighting for now.

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,430
We've already got an op up and running

79
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,210
to find the people who did this to you.

80
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,380
We'll protect you, mi amor,

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,000
even if it's from yourself.

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,790
That's what family does.

83
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,880
The Gravitonium from Deke's

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,780
gravity gizmo was intensely compressed.

85
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,280
Refined in a way that I cannot duplicate

86
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,420
with the raw element we got from the Principia.

87
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,890
Let alone inserting it into this new device.

88
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,470
So I was hoping that -- that Deke might be able

89
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,750
to have some more insight into exactly how it works.

90
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,840
Deke?

91
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,030
- Deke! - Okay. Well, I don't know much about the stuff inside.

92
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,630
I just know that it's saved --

93
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,560
saved my ass like a thousand times.

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,160
Okay, well, the short amount of time

95
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,210
that we bought ourselves is up.

96
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,440
So, what's the plan?

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,310
Well, I've temporarily plugged the dam,

98
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,960
but it could burst at any minute,

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,290
releasing more of these...

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,340
anomalies into the base.

101
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,120
Or worse, out into the world.

102
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,120
Are you okay, by the way? That could not have been easy.

103
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm fine.

104
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,390
The astronaut isn't even my greatest fear.

105
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,460
Goodness knows what else could come crawling out of there.

106
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,350
Just...trust me.

107
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,500
I can figure this out.

108
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,880
I just -- I need to...

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,500
I'll experiment all night if I have to.

110
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,630
Okay. So, what do we do?

111
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,210
Maybe I can find some of Dr. Franklin Hall's original notes.

112
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,160
Yeah, that could give us some insight

113
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,500
into the nature of the element.

114
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll see what I can find on the database.

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,020
And please be careful!

116
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,550
Just because we keep putting ourselves

117
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,760
in increasingly perilous situations,

118
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,860
which is worrisome,

119
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,870
and I just don't want

120
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,380
anything to happen to you -- your -- to your brains.

121
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,870
'Cause they're so smart that,

122
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,220
if -- we -- we need those to survive.

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,590
Thanks, Deke.

124
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,250
Come on.

125
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,010
They're okay, right?

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,520
Like, they're gon-- Like, they're gonna be --

127
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,260
they're gonna be fine?

128
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,100
They'll figure it out. Have faith.

129
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,150
Or a, you know,

130
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,740
Guess I was just super moved by their nuptials.

131
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,670
Become very invested in them as a couple.

132
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,590
I just want them to, you know,

133
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,860
last for, like, a long, long time.

134
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,100
Hold on.

135
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,350
Looks like we've got a tracking hit.

136
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,840
Our intel was right.

137
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,640
Everyone slips up sometimes, even Air Force Generals.

138
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,930
I'll send him the coordinates now.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,260
I was unaware that the timetable was so strict.

140
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm not making excuses, but there's no reason to --

141
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,120
Yes, we're close.

142
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,700
Looks like you were right.

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,080
Good first stop on your redemption tour.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Thank you, sir.

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Feels good to get one over on Hale in return.

146
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,370
‭You'd think our military would have better encryption on their phones.

147
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,980
Radio home.

148
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,720
Tell them we bagged us a general.

149
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,510
Fitz!

150
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,320
There you are.

151
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,740
They -- they told me to tell you

152
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,840
that they got her -- General Hale.

153
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
All right, well,

154
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,070
wasn't really expecting confetti or anything,

155
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,170
but maybe like a "Blimey"

156
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,980
or, like, some kind of acknowledgement.

157
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,770
You need a hand?

158
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm pretty good with metalwork.

159
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,600
I guess it runs in my DNA.

160
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,370
All right, man, well, I'm no doctor,

161
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,530
but that looks like the opposite of what you're sup--

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,130
No.

163
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm the only doctor here.

164
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,830
General Hale.

165
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,200
Soundproof walls. Low lighting.

166
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,810
Sensory deprivation?

167
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,750
What's next, blasting death metal?

168
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,450
I'm not here to torture you, General.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
I just want to sit down and talk,

170
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,220
ask you some questions that have been bugging me lately.

171
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,550
Where's my driver?

172
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,910
Let's start with why you've declared war on my people.

173
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,140
That's a tad dramatic.

174
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,750
I'm a general ‭in the United States Air Force.

175
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,770
You're the leader of a domestic terrorist organization.

176
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,100
I'm just trying ‭to bring you to justice.

177
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,700
I missed the part where "bring to justice"

178
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,640
and "blow up with beacon bombs" are analogous.

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,230
I have orders not to let you escape by any means.

180
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,410
I'm simply doing my job.

181
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,500
Is it your job to cut the arms off one of my agents?

182
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,840
For that, I do apologize.

183
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,650
One of my subordinates got a bit...overzealous.

184
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,190
I'm sure you can understand.

185
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,380
I mean, after all,

186
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,810
wasn't it your Agent Johnson

187
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,710
who shot our mutual friend Glenn Talbot in the head?

188
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,960
That wasn't Daisy.

189
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,470
Ever the guardian, huh?

190
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,790
"Get behind my shield. I'll protect you."

191
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,980
I can see why people follow you so blindly.

192
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,310
- It's called loyalty. - But only to a point.

193
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,260
You need more than that for what I'm trying to do.

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,470
And what would that be?

195
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,330
Prevent our extinction.

196
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
I need to access the main terminal.

197
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,460
Okay.

198
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,860
I couldn't find any ‭physical notes from Dr. Hall.

199
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,180
Tell me someone scanned them into the system.

200
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,370
Rude.

201
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,210
I-I already did, ‭and I couldn't find anything.

202
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,090
Nothing?

203
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,800
We have zero records of his actual research?

204
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,740
Nothing.

205
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,660
Fitz! Oh, my...

206
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,410
How is that possible?

207
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,470
Okay, you don't need to beat yourself

208
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,110
or the computer up over this.

209
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you okay? Have you even slept?

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,420
During what possible period of time, Daisy?

211
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,970
Okay, Fitz, you don't need to carry the weight of the world.

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,110
We are all here.

213
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,920
I mean, even Yo-Yo wants me to set up a security feed in the med bay

214
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,760
so she can watch out for anomalies.

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,260
What am I missing?

216
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,540
I --

217
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,320
No, no, no, no, no.

218
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,660
We just lost two cameras.

219
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,180
That's 10 levels below us.

220
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,860
Do you think it's another anomaly flare?

221
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,130
We know it can reach beyond its origin point.

222
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,850
If we don't contain it soon,

223
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,040
there won't be any safe levels in the whole base.

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Okay, well, I'll -- I'll go check it out.

225
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,930
We're all doing our part. Just take it easy, okay?

226
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,220
Okay.

227
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,580
Okay.

228
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,430
Okay.

229
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Just run possible simulations

230
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,290
to compensate

231
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,770
for the uneven distribution of...

232
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,580
Come on, Fitz.

233
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,480
Think!

234
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,700
You're on the right track.

235
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,620
You're not quite there yet.

236
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh, no.

237
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,840
No, you cannot be here.

238
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,260
There's work that needs to be finished.

239
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,240
What -- What work?

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,870
What are you -- ‭What are you doing here?

241
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,320
What you are unwilling to do.

242
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,240
Wait. What's going on?

243
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,440
More anomalies have begun occurring.

244
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,570
Until we get a better handle on the situation,

245
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,780
we're moving you to another floor

246
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,000
out of the line of fire.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,580
And what's my say in all this?

248
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,520
I'm not brain-dead. I can speak for myself.

249
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,160
We think you'll be safer on another floor.

250
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,120
Stop treating me like a child, Mack.

251
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,140
I'm an agent. Same as both of you.

252
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,390
If things are getting crazier around here,

253
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,930
then you need me more than ever.

254
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,610
I don't need you to protect me.

255
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,040
Don't move.

256
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,800
This can't be real.

257
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,610
Like the astronaut wasn't real?

258
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,550
Like the world -- my world --

259
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,050
that you destroyed wasn't real?

260
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
Come on.

261
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,330
We both know better than that.

262
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,750
I'm very real.

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,110
And I am gonna finish

264
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,440
what you started.

265
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,880
I didn't start anything. That was all you.

266
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,480
Not me. That's not me.

267
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,870
But you and I are the same,

268
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,060
aren't we...Fitz?

269
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
That's what ‭they call you here, isn't it?

270
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,390
So familiar.

271
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,600
No.

272
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,330
No, 'cause --

273
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,100
No, whatever it is that you're plotting, I'll stop you.

274
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,090
Come on.

275
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,300
You couldn't stop me if you wanted to.

276
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,050
Plans are already in motion.

277
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,110
No!

278
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,630
Fitz!

279
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,240
You can't escape me, Fitz.

280
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,390
We're not finished yet.

281
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,500
Saving humanity --

282
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,640
that's usually my line.

283
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,100
I don't think you understand the forces at play here.

284
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,460
My vantage point ‭is much higher than yours.

285
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,360
What are you trying to save the planet from?

286
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,850
Why do you need the Gravitonium?

287
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,700
No. I understand you, Agent Coulson.

288
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,160
I even admire you a bit.

289
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,820
But I don't trust you yet.

290
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,350
That feeling is becoming increasingly mutual.

291
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,500
You're not exactly giving off benevolent vibes here.

292
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,460
Benevolence is not enough.

293
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,190
Your charisma and empathy is only gonna get you so far.

294
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,840
I don't lose sleep at night

295
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,300
worrying ‭about the difficult calls.

296
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,620
I do what's necessary.

297
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,680
And, yes, sometimes, people have to die.

298
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,720
But I'm willing to pull the trigger.

299
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,230
Are you?

300
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,300
If the right person's on the other end of the gun.

301
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,350
Then let me point it in the right direction.

302
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,540
Let me show you what we are really up against.

303
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,440
Come with me.

304
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,340
No, thank you.

305
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,740
I don't like taking orders from backseat pilots.

306
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,400
But I've always been in the driver's seat.

307
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,970
Oh, come on.

308
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,480
Do you really think that hacking my phone

309
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,870
was some sort of stealthy exploit

310
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,290
I was unaware of?

311
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,420
You underestimate me.

312
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,310
What is it, Piper?

313
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,820
We tried to pull the sleeping driver out of the car.

314
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,090
- And? - We couldn't lift him, ma'am.

315
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,120
He's too heavy.

316
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,630
An android?

317
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,890
More like a statue.

318
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,810
It hasn't moved.

319
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,220
What is it?

320
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,450
Get out of the car, Mr. Creel.

321
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,780
Agent May.

322
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,590
You're working for Hale?

323
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,070
I suggest you listen to what she has to say.

324
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,770
She can be persuasive.

325
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,400
Don't beat yourself up.

326
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,710
You did what you were told, gave us the contact numbers --

327
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,100
the rest is on me.

328
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,500
I acted too fast on the intel.

329
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,770
Another trap.

330
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,610
Feels like you'd be safer if you just tossed me out of the plane.

331
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,420
We should at least consider it.

332
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,810
Agent Coulson.

333
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,260
So good to see you again.

334
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,450
What the hell happened?

335
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,560
That robo-assassin burst in and shot Mack.

336
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,150
Yeah, but I won, though.

337
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,580
Gunshot wound to the leg. No major arteries hit.

338
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm fine.

339
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,500
I thought you deactivated those things

340
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,030
before bringing them back.

341
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,320
It's not an anomaly?

342
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,000
No, it would have disappeared. That thing is real.

343
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,530
How the hell could that have happened?

344
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,180
How did he get put back together?

345
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,660
It was him.

346
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,810
Him who?

347
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,210
The other.

348
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,400
The -- The Doc-- The Doctor from -- from the Framework.

349
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,630
Leopold.

350
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,290
He's here.

351
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,240
You didn't really think you'd seen the last of me, did you?

352
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,690
I should have known there was more of you out in the wind.

353
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,060
You squash one cockroach,

354
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,260
there's bound to be others nearby.

355
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,540
Although I think you will find

356
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,810
I do not squash so easily these days.

357
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,800
So much for the "Superior humanity" schtick.

358
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,470
I have simply redefined what that means.

359
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,530
Parts of me will always be human.

360
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,980
But I have gained so much more with this new form.

361
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,310
Strength.

362
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,570
Immortality.

363
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,890
How's that for a cool origin story, bro?

364
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,530
So, what?

365
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,060
You turned over a new leaf?

366
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,930
Or just another Russian infiltrating our democracy?

367
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,590
Humanity still stands threatened.

368
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,030
I will ensure this planet's survival for generations.

369
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,990
But Hale is an important part of that.

370
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,950
So you're the one holding her leash?

371
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,300
You will bring her to me.

372
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,020
Or Mr. Creel will blow this lovely plane out of the sky.

373
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,980
He and I will survive, of course, but...

374
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,020
I am less confident about your chances.

375
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,630
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

376
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,500
This is my fault. If I'd just --

377
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,220
If I could have just worked out how to s-shut the rift sooner,

378
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,920
then -- then my greatest fear wouldn't be...

379
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,700
Who says it's your greatest fear?

380
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,280
Who cares whose fear it is?

381
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,780
What matters is stopping him.

382
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,890
What does he want?

383
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,740
I don't -- I don't know.

384
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,900
But you do, Fitz.

385
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,510
He is you, so just think.

386
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,010
No, I -- No. I-I don't know.

387
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,800
You have to try.

388
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,020
This is our only lead to gain some insight

389
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,070
into -- into what he might be after.

390
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,130
He said that he wanted to do what I was unable to do.

391
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,140
To finish what was started.

392
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,080
W-What does that mean? What --

393
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,820
Is he trying to bring back Aida and make her another body?

394
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,560
After Ghost Rider?

395
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,410
I don't think there's any coming back from that.

396
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,250
That wasn't his only operation in the Framework.

397
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,030
He was also in charge of Inhuman experimentation.

398
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,880
That's why he sent that Terminator after Yo-Yo.

399
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,260
And that means he's also after...

400
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,000
Daisy.

401
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,960
Where is she?

402
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,580
There was a surveillance shortage on one of the other levels.

403
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,910
- She went to check it out. - Okay, we have to --

404
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,760
we have to lock down the base, close the Doctor in.

405
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,110
I'll find her.

406
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,680
What the hell?

407
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,370
There's nothing wrong with you.

408
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,550
Okay, wild goose, one. Daisy Johnson, zero.

409
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,830
That moral high ground is eroding at your feet.

410
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,170
Utilizing robots built by terrorists?

411
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,840
You're standing next to the man responsible for shooting Talbot.

412
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,320
Daisy Johnson shot Talbot. I saw the tape.

413
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,790
That was an android. And programmed by him.

414
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,480
He's an android programmed by Leopold Fitz.

415
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,830
You want proof?

416
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,300
Let's tear Anton apart, limb by limb.

417
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,670
His electronic parts look

418
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,400
remarkably like S.H.I.E.L.D. Tech.

419
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,230
- That's not what happened. - What's your proof?

420
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,520
You see how little you control?

421
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,890
Yes, there's much to understand.

422
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,010
But I can help you with that.

423
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,490
Coulson, come with me.

424
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,200
He's not going anywhere.

425
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,490
I come with you, ‭my people get away unharmed.

426
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,340
I can agree to that.

427
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,070
Excuse us.

428
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,450
‭You can't be serious, Phil.

429
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,450
We've been behind her this entire time.

430
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,370
If I can get clarity on what we're dealing with,

431
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,060
then all the better.

432
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,520
Oh, and we don't discuss it?

433
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,280
- We know this is a trap, Phil. - ‭Yeah.

434
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,470
- And it's a really good one, too. - Don't do that.

435
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,310
Not now. Not when you're turning your back on me.

436
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,920
Turning my back on you?

437
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,030
What other way out is there?

438
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,150
- This is unavoidable. - It's suicidal.

439
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,750
Which is now ‭a recurring theme for you.

440
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm not airing our dirty laundry

441
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,850
in front of the bad guys right now.

442
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,470
How considerate.

443
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,640
He's all yours.

444
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,710
Fitz.

445
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,990
Oh, come on, Agent Johnson.

446
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,900
That's not how you address a Hydra superior.

447
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,930
What -- What -- What's going on?

448
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,520
- Escape is unlikely. - What?

449
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,900
Between the restraints and the carisoprodol,

450
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,490
your energy would be better spent

451
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,110
making yourself ‭as comfortable as possible.

452
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm afraid I didn't have too many painkillers.

453
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,210
You're not Fitz.

454
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,560
You are another anomaly.

455
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,600
Where is Fitz? Where's the real Fitz?

456
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,250
Oh, believe me -- you're looking at him.

457
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,910
Okay, so, what is this?

458
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,230
Uh, is it payback, huh, for the Framework?

459
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,430
I know you like your Inhumans alive

460
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,920
when you turn them inside out.

461
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,090
My Inhuman work

462
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,970
not only took threats off the streets...

463
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,900
deepened their understanding of their powers.

464
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,500
That's a Nobel Prize speech.

465
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,610
My work helps people...

466
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,190
which is precisely what I'm doing now

467
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,480
by restoring your powers.

468
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,700
What? No.

469
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,840
No. No! No, no.

470
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,280
I've told you. I've told you.

471
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,300
Try and make yourself as comfortable as possible.

472
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,360
No. No, you can't -- No, no, no!

473
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,520
Put it on.

474
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,590
I'll need to scan ‭your hand, too, for weapons.

475
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,770
You know, somehow,

476
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,000
this is only the second-worst party invitation I've ever received.

477
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
Just put the damn hood on, Coulson.

478
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,330
You know me, Carl.

479
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,110
Whatever lies Hale is selling you --

480
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,650
Look at how he scrambles to save face.

481
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,540
You're still here.

482
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,290
Speaking of faces,

483
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,920
how come your robo-warriors don't have any?

484
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,910
They are merely soldiers.

485
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,170
Tools for battle.

486
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,650
Interesting.

487
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,380
'Cause, see, I think, when you lost your partner Aida,

488
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,700
you lost the ability to make convincing LMDs.

489
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,650
That's why Hale isn't one.

490
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,250
And you know what else I think?

491
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,810
You're not the one calling the shots here.

492
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,560
What happened, bro?

493
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,170
Hale must have your balls in a vise.

494
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,270
Actually... it's his head in a jar.

495
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,230
Please, don't do this.

496
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,520
You know what restoring my powers could do.

497
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,620
You -- No.

498
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,890
Conversely... ‭

499
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,140
...this rift could be what destroys the world.

500
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,530
Your powers could be what save it.

501
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,220
No.

502
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,670
This is the path to destruction.

503
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,140
You...

504
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,230
...are what's needed to compress the Gravitonium

505
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,990
and insert it into the device to shut the rift for good.

506
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,940
My hypothesis has science to back it up.

507
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,670
What does yours have?

508
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,380
Stop!

509
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,750
Fitz?

510
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,120
What are you doing to her?

511
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,020
How many times do I have to say it?

512
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,280
What needs to be done.

513
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,610
‭Mack, you need to sit down.

514
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,190
Take the weight off that leg.

515
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,490
Not a chance.

516
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,960
Not when more of those things could be coming after you.

517
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Nothing's going to happen to me.

518
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,720
You're damn right ‭nothing's gonna happen to you.

519
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,500
Not on my watch.

520
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,700
No, Mack.

521
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,580
Nothing can happen to me.

522
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,850
What's that supposed to mean?

523
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,920
Well, think about it.

524
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,490
You saw me in the Lighthouse.

525
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,310
You know I make it ‭to that point in the future.

526
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,200
Nothing can happen to me until then.

527
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,070
You just lost both your arms.

528
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,170
- That's not nothing. - But I didn't die.

529
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,430
The future we saw isn't guaranteed.

530
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,170
We're actively working to make sure it doesn't come true.

531
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,640
That means you could still die.

532
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,520
I could still lose you.

533
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,470
What then?

534
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,060
Well, then, ‭we would have broken the loop.

535
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,800
Mack. ‭You need to stay off that leg.

536
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,400
I tried to tell him.

537
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,470
Well, you just don't want to re-aggravate that...injury.

538
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,760
Have Fitz or Daisy checked in yet?

539
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,180
No, he's still out there, looking for her.

540
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,840
Stay with her.

541
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,810
Ev-- Everything -- Everything's gonna be fine, Daisy, okay?

542
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,110
It will be if you let me finish.

543
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,420
You are a monster.

544
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,150
You programmed those robots to attack Yo-Yo,

545
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,710
and now you've got Daisy lying on an operating table.

546
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,000
If the robot attacked,

547
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,830
it must be because it was provoked.

548
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,910
I simply programmed it

549
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,740
to keep Mack and the others at bay

550
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,980
while I set to work ‭removing Daisy's inhibitor.

551
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,580
What?

552
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,380
Well, her powers are the missing key

553
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,040
to manipulating the Gravitonium.

554
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,160
What's going on?

555
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,230
They're -- They're -- Wait. Stop.

556
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,590
Just stop, stop, stop, stop.

557
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,220
You know that I'm right.

558
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,970
No. No.

559
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,700
Because -- Because -- Because -- Because I'll --

560
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,810
You'll what?

561
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,730
Look at you.

562
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,350
You are weak!

563
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,320
But together, we can fix it.

564
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,120
Who are you talking to?

565
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,540
No. No.

566
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,020
Finish what we started.

567
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,130
No!

568
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,940
Fitz!

569
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,080
Simmons...help me...

570
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,310
Put the scalpel down.

571
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,170
Fitz...

572
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,570
What?

573
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
It's not me.

574
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,420
It's not me -- it's...

575
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,400
He w-- He was -- He was right here.

576
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,660
He was right --

577
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,800
What is happening?

578
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,090
Fitz...

579
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,150
it wasn't an anomaly.

580
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,500
It was you.

581
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,880
Programming the robots.

582
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,320
Keeping everyone else occupied.

583
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,820
I couldn't find any physical notes from Dr. Hall.

584
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,200
We just lost two cameras.

585
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,690
That's 10 levels below us.

586
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,680
To isolate Daisy.

587
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,560
All part of his...plan.

588
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,550
Of my plan.

589
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,770
Hey, look at me.

590
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,870
We can work all of this out.

591
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,270
- You just need to let Daisy go. - No.

592
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,810
There's no turning back.

593
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,610
Of course there is.

594
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,310
He planned for that, too.

595
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,970
You would point a gun at me?

596
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,220
The Doctor would.

597
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,580
He programmed it to make sure I'd go through with it.

598
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,520
He didn't want to hurt you.

599
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,700
Just like he didn't want to hurt Mack.

600
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,260
But it's just --

601
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,140
I wouldn't have done any of this

602
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,420
if I didn't believe it was going to work.

603
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,120
You don't know it's going to work.

604
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,770
The science is sound.

605
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,440
There are always risks involved.

606
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,890
You know that, Jemma.

607
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,780
You're right, but...

608
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,780
potentially paralyzing Daisy or destroying the world

609
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,410
are two massive risks, Fitz.

610
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,000
Let's hope that that doesn't happen.

611
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,320
No. No, no, no, no, no.

612
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,770
Fitz, Fitz, Fitz! No, please.

613
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,530
Please, Fitz. Fitz, I am begging you.

614
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,970
Please, ‭you do not want to do this.

615
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,050
No...I don't.

616
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,670
- But I have to. - No, no, no, no.

617
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,120
No, no, no, no!

618
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,750
I will --

619
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,930
I will never forgive you.

620
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,480
I suspect you won't be the only one.

621
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,490
The adrenaline will help jump-start your powers.

622
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,260
Here's what you need to do.

623
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,590
You need to compress the Gravitonium down as much as possible.

624
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,230
Then carefully guide it over

625
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,790
and insert it into the sphere.

626
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,510
How long ‭have you been seeing him?

627
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,490
My mind's been through a lot.

628
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Been hearing him for a while now.

629
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,300
Since we left the Framework.

630
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,830
Only just started seeing him.

631
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,210
It's your injury acting up.

632
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,970
You used to see me, too, when I wasn't there.

633
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,520
You were my conscience.

634
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,600
Then what was he?

635
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,160
You had a psychic split.

636
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,310
But that dark persona, that's not you.

637
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,470
It is me.

638
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,040
It's not an apparition.

639
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,110
It's not some evil doppelganger.

640
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,940
It...was...me.

641
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,830
How are Daisy and Mack?

642
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,280
You have to talk to them.

643
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,060
They can come to forgive you if you just explain --

644
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,330
I don't deserve forgiveness, Jemma.

645
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,320
Just like you don't deserve me?

646
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,120
Mack's injured.

647
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,840
Daisy's traumatized.

648
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,440
Do you know what the worst part about all of this is?

649
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,500
I still believe that it was the right thing to do.

650
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,110
And you're right.

651
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,040
It's such a...confusing gray area.

652
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,220
But if we are going to change the timeline,

653
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,490
we have to do things differently.

654
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,140
Make harder choices.

655
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,510
What does that make us?

656
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,210
I don't know.

657
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,730
I really don't know where we go from here.

658
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,760
I don't know really what to say.

659
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,990
That's a first.

660
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
I guess I don't ‭have to ask how you're doing.

661
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,020
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,820
You didn't deserve that.

663
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,700
You're a victim in all of this, too.

664
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,060
I just don't --

665
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,510
I don't really know how to process it.

666
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,880
He's losing himself.

667
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,650
I feel like I'm losing him, too.

668
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,050
You haven't lost him.

669
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,350
You know him better than he even knows himself.

670
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,370
He's complicated.

671
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,380
And he's stubborn.

672
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,070
Yes.

673
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,080
That's why you let him win arguments sometimes, right?

674
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,800
He can be a real baby when he's sick,

675
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,870
so that's why you got to take care of him.

676
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,270
And he's always got the weight of the world on his shoulders.

677
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,440
That's why he needs you there to help lighten the load.

678
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,840
Oh, and he loves his prosciutto and mozzarella sandwiches

679
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,780
that no one can make right except you.

680
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,080
How could you possibly know all those things?

681
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,610
Because my mom used to tell me about her parents all the time.

682
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,750
She always spoke about her dad

683
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,700
with so much love ‭and admiration on her face.

684
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,380
Said that he was the best man she ever knew.

685
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,830
So I know that you can help Fitz.

686
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,090
And I know that you two are gonna be okay

687
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:13,260
because...the steps you take don't need to be big...

688
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,850
...they just need to take you in the right direction.

689
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,890
W--

690
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,570
You're our grandson?

691
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,940
We'll return in a moment.

692
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,670
Apologies for the delay.

693
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,270
Still empty-handed.

694
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,210
You see how your lack of results

695
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,010
could be construed as ineptitude.

696
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,170
If you thought less of me, I wouldn't be here.

697
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,050
You're here because the Confederacy allows it.

698
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,770
You want a seat at the table,

699
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,750
you must prove you are deserving of it.

700
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,120
I've secured what I believe to be the final piece.

701
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,730
It's all within reach.

702
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,240
Always said prior to failure.

703
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,390
No, I'd die before that happened.

704
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,170
Well, before you do that,

705
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,740
there's a tradition within the Confederacy.

706
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,890
If one faces failure, you drink the Odium.

707
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,660
Fight your last in a wave of savage glory.

708
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,540
But if your resolve is as strong as you claim,

709
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,100
you'll have no need of it.

710
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,670
I hope fortune turns your way.

711
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,400
And, of course...

712
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,040
Hail Hydra.
