1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,440
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,420
We have to live with the choices we make.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,890
And how I have to make mine.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,960
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse,

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,980
so she thinks she can't be killed.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,360
You're our grandson.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,190
His very existence proves that

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,930
you and I make it to the Lighthouse.

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,260
Do you see what this means?

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,290
It means you and I are invincible.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,660
You cut into me.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,500
You are not leaving this room.

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,510
I come with you, my people get away unharmed.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,390
I can agree to that.

15
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,580
You want to bring Robin out of hiding

16
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,560
and risk her getting hurt?

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Our leader is missing. We have to get him back.

18
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,700
Well, we know that Hale went after Gravitonium,

19
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,610
so I think she's trying to build a weapon.

20
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,230
It's a particle-infusion chamber.

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,930
If the idea is to put your ninja daughter into that,

22
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,570
this is gonna be a long conversation.

23
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,540
She's not ready.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm wondering if your Daisy Johnson is a better fit.

25
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,560
She would be worthy of Whitehall's code name for the project --

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,220
Destroyer of Worlds.

27
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,250
No. No, stop.

28
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,840
You're making a huge mistake!

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,710
No!

30
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,520
General Hale.

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,360
I know you're bummed the whole team-up thing

32
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,730
isn't gonna happen.

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,400
But it still seems kind of petty,

34
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,440
taking away my cot...

35
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,520
my chair...

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,530
and my Cap'n Crunch.

37
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,890
That last one really hurt.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,460
And you're gonna destroy the Earth, so...

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,460
I told you we'd get Coulson.

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,680
And he'll pay for General Talbot

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,480
after he's turned over his Inhumans.

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,090
But for now...

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,510
I know you enjoy it,

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,810
the feel of a new material.

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,150
I've been looking forward to this one.

46
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,250
The question is, what do you want me to do with it?

47
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,240
Whitehall, Strucker, even Talbot --

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,690
they all wanted your compliance.

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm offering transformation.

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,520
Into what?

51
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,140
A hero.

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,820
Show us what you can do.

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,550
Why hand him this?

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,750
Talbot already gave up the location of the chamber.

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,130
Yes, ‭and we're waiting for Strucker

56
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,790
to show us how to put it together.

57
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,580
His father never made it easy

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,060
for someone to steal his work.

59
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,100
- But Creel -- ‭- Creel will give us answers.

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,520
No one understood Gravitonium except for Ian Quinn,

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
and he's been in hiding for years.

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,630
But if Creel touches it --

63
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,050
Yes, he'll help us understand what we're dealing with here.

64
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,460
Before you give it to me.

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,560
I don't want to infuse your cells

66
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,780
with something we know nothing about.

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,550
So then why not talk to Coulson about it?

68
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,450
He has experience with it.

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
And I think after two days in isolation,

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,150
maybe an olive branch --

71
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,650
We've done the olive branch.

72
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,780
We stick the screws to him now.

73
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,870
A week without sleep and food,

74
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,950
we'll see what he has to say.

75
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,200
Let's begin.

76
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,420
Hey! Get me out!

77
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,780
Get me out of here!

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Stop!

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,590
What happened?

80
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,950
What did you feel?

81
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,370
It's alive.

82
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,100
Wow. Hey, Simmons was right.

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,480
She said you might ‭become stronger than before,

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,830
but you're murdering that heavy bag.

85
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,710
Yeah.

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,890
Feels good to not be laying on a bed for once.

87
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,900
Yeah, well, maybe -- ‭Unh!

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,360
Maybe don't push too hard, though.

89
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,730
We just put those things on you.

90
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,090
I'm fine.

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,660
I'm just getting used to them.

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,250
Look, I know you like to do things fast,

93
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,480
but you don't know your strength yet.

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,050
So maybe a little caution couldn't hurt for a change.

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,550
‭I know that speech by heart.

96
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,830
Well, you're the one talking about how you're indestructible

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,170
and saying you can't die.

98
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,280
How was I supposed to take that?

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,690
I guess it was just, uh...

100
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,820
the pain medication talking.

101
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,260
Yeah.

102
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,230
Well, ‭you can at least hydrate.

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,800
Okay, Pacquiao?

104
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,830
And later on, I can run a diagnostic on those arms.

105
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,030
What? ‭Don't look at me like that.

106
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,380
What, I'm not babying you. I'm a mechanic.

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,270
A well-oiled machine needs oil.

108
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,350
Okay, yeah.

109
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,940
I don't see it.

110
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,920
None of you looks like me.

111
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,760
Well, I don't know ‭what to tell you, Grandpappy.

112
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,730
I guess your daughter found a real man.

113
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,640
Of all people.

114
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,880
Why couldn't it be Flint?

115
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,560
I liked Flint.

116
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,140
Well, that's a lovely sentiment.

117
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,350
That's almost as loving as when you had a robot...

118
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,500
point a gun to my head.

119
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,040
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

120
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,040
It's fine. It's the first move you made

121
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,570
that actually made me respect you a little bit.

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
It's my kind of move.

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,340
And this place, 80 years from now,

124
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,350
I'd survived on moves like that.

125
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,070
'Cause it was kill or be killed.

126
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,940
I know Johnson's still mad at me

127
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,790
about the whole "selling her into slavery" thing,

128
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,480
but you got to play the long game,

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,270
or else the whole world is gonna be a vacancy, right?

130
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,870
Maybe.

131
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,580
And you say ‭you don't see the resemblance?

132
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,530
Okay. Well, quality time was fun, but I'm late.

133
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,960
I don't know if you noticed, but...

134
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,490
ever since she's been in charge,

135
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,480
Daisy's kind of a hard-ass.

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,370
I noticed.

137
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,610
Can I pick your brain for a minute?

138
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,740
That's a weird saying.

139
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,960
I was hoping you could tell me more about our future.

140
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,400
I mean, you saw it -- it sucked.

141
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,860
No, I mean Fitz and me.

142
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,870
Do you recall any evidence of major injury,

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,590
any noticeable scarring, perhaps?

144
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,790
I don't remember you guys at all.

145
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,150
I didn't even know your real names.

146
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,340
Everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. changed them

147
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
when they were getting hunted down.

148
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,880
I just knew you as Nana and Bobo.

149
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,420
But you guys ‭made it to the Lighthouse.

150
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,010
Good to hear.

151
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,110
Mom talked about you a lot

152
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,570
but never mentioned any health stuff.

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm pretty sure you were tiptop.

154
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,530
You remind me of her.

155
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,660
If you want, I could tell you stories about what you --

156
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,320
I think it's best not to know too much.

157
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,520
It's enough to know Fitz and I live long enough to create her.

158
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,030
Yeah, well, you certainly will,

159
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,120
as long as you guys...

160
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,790
you know...

161
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,360
But anyway, I-I don't know how much longer I'm gonna make it

162
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,050
if I don't get a move on, because...

163
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,010
I don't know if you noticed,

164
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,710
but ever since she's been in charge,

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,130
Daisy has really just become a hard-ass.

166
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,760
I noticed.

167
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,170
You sure about this?

168
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,070
I understand the risk of taking her out of hiding,

169
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,780
but Robin is our best shot at finding Coulson.

170
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,940
I have to talk to her.

171
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,620
And look, I -- I get that you're afraid to see her again,

172
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,100
but she's ‭the most powerful tool we have.

173
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,340
She's just a kid.

174
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,690
Sorry I'm -- I'm late.

175
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,400
I was just -- just getting all my gear together,

176
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,830
but I'm ready to go. Geared up. Mission-ready.

177
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,110
I'll just go ahead and get to the command center.

178
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,000
- Was he late? - ‭I have no idea.

179
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,670
What's up?

180
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,440
I was hoping to have another word with you about Fitz.

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,160
We can't have that ‭conversation again, Simmons.

182
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,900
Yes, well, Robin may have answers,

183
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,050
but she may not,

184
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,470
whereas Fitz has a concrete lead on a Hydra weapon.

185
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,910
We get to that first, we get to Hale.

186
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,970
That could lead to Coulson and --

187
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,190
Fitz is sick.

188
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,220
You should be worried about that.

189
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, you can compile his intel,

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,340
and we will review it when we get back.

191
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,820
But right now, Zephyr One is leaving.

192
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,940
And, Simmons, ‭Mack is in charge when I'm gone,

193
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,100
and he's under strict orders Fitz stays locked up.

194
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
Understood?

195
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,110
I understand what you're saying.

196
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,200
Good.

197
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,080
You might want to dial it back.

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,190
- I think she's wrong. - You made that perfectly clear.

199
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,540
But you're leading us now,

200
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,890
and it's new to everyone, not just you.

201
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm just leading us to Coulson. Then he can have his job back.

202
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,700
Daisy won't listen. I think it's time we try a new approach.

203
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,050
To what? Why'd you drag me here?

204
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,070
Because I've realized we have to think differently.

205
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,100
Fitz started to, and he's paying for it.

206
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,540
But you can't deny it worked.

207
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,160
And you.

208
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,640
Mack said you believe you can't die.

209
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,820
I know it sounds crazy, Jemma --

210
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,080
I don't think it's crazy.

211
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,610
I believe it's true.

212
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,830
I'm glad someone understands.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
I don't just mean you.

214
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,520
You guys didn't see yourselves in the future.

215
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,010
No. Deke is our proof.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,950
His mother...

217
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,080
was our daughter.

218
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,360
- Deke... - Is our grandson.

219
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,630
- Thank you. ‭- No, no, ‭it's really quite sweet.

221
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,290
Well, it makes as much sense as anything else.

222
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,040
So we're ‭the invincible three, huh?

223
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,720
Now what?

224
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,040
Daisy's taking a long shot to find where Hale is keeping Coulson,

225
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,230
but we have something concrete

226
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,990
that can get us one step ahead of her.

227
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,930
That sounds good.

228
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,670
Hale may be after ‭a weapon powered by Gravitonium,

229
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,770
probably in a location

230
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,340
that Malick turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

231
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,600
That sounds bad. I'm in.

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
So we go to these places and knock down doors?

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,460
I can knock down doors now.

234
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,920
I can't go anywhere.

235
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,740
Fitz...

236
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,400
I know you feel like you're battling something inside you,

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,560
but I trust you.

238
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,030
Do you trust me?

239
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,160
Yeah.

240
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,410
Why?

241
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,280
Because I'm going to get you out.

242
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
And we're going to go after this thing.

243
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

244
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,400
We have a problem.

245
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,510
Mack -- he's the only one that can open Fitz's cell now.

246
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,370
He won't want to, Jemma.

247
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,860
He'll stop us.

248
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,570
No.

249
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,480
He'll try.

250
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,750
It's far too powerful for you, for him.

251
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,880
Mr. Creel.

252
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
How are you feeling?

253
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,190
It won't leave my head.

254
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,840
Whatever's in there, I can't control it.

255
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,980
I think this is more about what's happening inside you.

256
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,710
What are you talking about?

257
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,990
You and I are a creation of the old Hydra.

258
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,780
That was destroyed.

259
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,630
When the thing we ‭identify with most falls apart,

260
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,770
we lose our footing.

261
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,860
We don't know what our next step is.

262
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,360
I didn't choose to be created by them.

263
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,260
But you get to choose now.

264
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,550
That's not what this feels like.

265
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,750
That's what you want.

266
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,270
We're going to conduct another test soon.

267
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,960
Whether you take that next step is up to you.

268
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,550
Watch your heads.

269
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,390
Just try to get comfortable, and...

270
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,600
we'll take off in a few minutes.

271
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
Thanks.

272
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
It's nice to see Mr. Fitz got you all back.

273
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,740
It's good to see you guys, too.

274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,660
I-I'm -- I'm sorry ‭to take you out of hiding.

275
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,440
I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't...

276
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,520
really important.

277
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,570
Hi, Robin.

278
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,790
Let's get you into a seat, honey.

279
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,410
She hasn't been doing well --

280
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,670
for a couple weeks.

281
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,340
She isn't speaking to me.

282
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,810
She isn't drawing pictures.

283
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,430
I don't know what she's seeing.

284
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,170
Whatever it is, it's overwhelming her.

285
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,740
I understand that feeling.

286
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,430
Maybe I can find out what's on her mind.

287
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,840
Good.

288
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,790
Uh, take these to be translated.

289
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't speak German.

290
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,530
Is something wrong?

291
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,580
Well, do these have ‭the answer we're looking for

292
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,370
or just more musings from a Hydra has-been?

293
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,510
My father ‭kept everything separate.

294
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,900
There's no single journal

295
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,500
that explains how the chamber works.

296
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,190
A-Assembly, the mechanics, the infusion process...

297
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,790
So then, ‭we're still missing something.

298
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,770
I am trying to re-create these as fast as I can,

299
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,090
to understand it all.

300
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,920
We may be running out of time.

301
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,440
My mother just gave Creel the Gravitonium --

302
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,060
a new toy for him to play with.

303
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,630
Creel?

304
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,410
What, is he ‭the -- the test subject?

305
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,850
That's what she says, but...

306
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,230
she's up to something, and I can feel it.

307
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,580
She wanted to join forces with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

308
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,750
with Daisy Johnson.

309
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,960
The Gravitonium is meant for you.

310
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
She can't make him into the --

311
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,560
The Destroyer of Worlds?

312
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,130
I've worked myself to the bone,

313
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,550
trained my whole life to become this.

314
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,330
And I'm so close.

315
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,550
I'll get you there.

316
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,470
I'll work harder.

317
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,770
I just -- I need to think.

318
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,990
Zephyr One, we're en route to you.

319
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,300
- Five minutes out. - Copy that.

320
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,000
You have the cargo onboard?

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,090
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,050
Safe and secure.

323
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,560
It's okay ‭if you don't want to talk.

324
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,080
You saw something frightening.

325
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,270
It's okay ‭if you're feeling scared.

326
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,270
I was scared of my powers, too.

327
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,360
I couldn't...

328
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,920
control it, I couldn't escape it.

329
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,730
But it -- it'll get better.

330
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,020
It will.

331
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
I promise.

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,120
I wouldn't ask you

333
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,120
to think about anything you don't want to.

334
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,570
But my friend, Phillip J. Coulson...

335
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,120
he's the one who helped me get better.

336
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,090
And right now, he's lost.

337
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,530
And I need...

338
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,850
I need to find him.

339
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,220
Robin, can you help me find him?

340
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,470
Please?

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,640
Structure looks good.

342
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,550
Hydraulics are okay.

343
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,040
I guess you didn't do any damage with all that punching.

344
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,470
Yeah, these things are pretty tough.

345
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
Well, if the arm fits...

346
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,510
So you're making arm jokes now?

347
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,360
I thought those were off-limits.

348
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,240
All right, ‭it'll be the first and last.

349
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,460
I'm just glad to see that these are...

350
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,510
...are in good shape.

351
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,840
Yeah, um...

352
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,380
I'd like to do more than...

353
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,450
work out and get check-ups.

354
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah?

355
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,170
I want you ‭to let Fitz out of his cell.

356
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,010
Why?

357
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,450
Because he knows about a weapon that General Hale wants

358
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,610
that uses gravity, ‭and we need to get it first.

359
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,070
You know what Fitz did.

360
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,030
Take it up with Coulson when we get him back.

361
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,060
And what if we can't wait for that, Mack?

362
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,120
Maybe it's time for others to step up.

363
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,800
I saw myself alive in the future.

364
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,830
I want to use that to help --

365
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,350
Damn it, Elena! That doesn't make you bulletproof.

366
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,810
I thought you let go of that.

367
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,060
There are things I can't let go of --

368
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,320
things I learned in the future about this team,

369
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,220
about Coulson, about you.

370
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,280
I don't want to hear about the future!

371
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,710
Look, all I know is,

372
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,570
right here, right now, you're in front of me.

373
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,590
Safe.

374
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,070
You can't protect me forever, Mack.

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,250
Did you ever stop to think maybe you're alive in the future

376
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,370
because I did?

377
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,690
Fitz stays where he is.

378
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,410
And so do you.

379
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,870
I see the future, Mr. Coulson.

380
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,570
You can tell the General there's nothing you can do

381
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,250
to make me join ‭her evil league of evil.

382
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,160
I'm not her messenger boy.

383
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,650
‭Gravitonium.

384
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,640
It hates you.

385
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,170
It wants you dead.

386
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,920
You don't look so great, Carl.

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,040
If you're messing ‭with that stuff, believe me,

388
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,620
you don't want to be the guinea pig in Hale's experiment.

389
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,420
S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as guilty of the same thing --

390
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,240
experimentation without thought of consequence.

391
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,550
S.H.I.E.L.D. may not be perfect,

392
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,660
but we'd never do ‭what Hale did to Talbot.

393
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
I thought he was your friend.

394
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
What do you mean?

395
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,910
You don't know.

396
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,460
Talbot is Hale's prisoner, too.

397
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,880
- She broke him. - ‭No.

398
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,600
She said she was getting him care no one else could.

399
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,180
Helping him heal.

400
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,290
That's a touching story.

401
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,860
And I should believe you instead?

402
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
You don't have to believe me because every few minutes,

403
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,470
a mech guard comes to check on that door,

404
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,940
and it's been a few minutes.

405
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,660
You have a choice to make, Carl.

406
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,060
That's a choice.

407
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Let's see ‭if your story checks out.

408
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,670
If it doesn't, I'll do the same to you.

409
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,510
She still won't talk with me.

410
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,360
I thought I'd have until she was 13

411
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,570
before she completely tuned me out.

412
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm sorry we're not able to help.

413
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,570
Please, do not apologize.

414
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,400
This -- This cannot be easy for you.

415
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,810
She can see the future,

416
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,180
and I don't even have the power to know what she's feeling.

417
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,050
At least when she would draw,

418
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,900
I'd have a window into her world.

419
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,510
Do you remember what her last drawing was?

420
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,730
I have it.

421
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,160
Do you know what it means?

422
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,530
No, Robin!

423
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,440
I'm not sure.

424
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,540
Mom?

425
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,940
Mommy.

426
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,140
I missed you.

427
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,980
I told you ‭Flint would get you back.

428
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,050
You did.

429
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,860
You were right.

430
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,870
This base is a labyrinth.

431
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,930
Is this the right place?

432
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,920
It's the only wing Hale made off-limits.

433
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,350
Maybe there's a reason for that.

434
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,670
And you can open these doors?

435
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,180
Yeah. Just need to know which one Talbot's in.

436
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,750
If what you said is true --

437
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,920
Straighten up and fly right, Hammond!

438
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,790
You look like a damn hobo!

439
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,410
Pretty sure that's our man.

440
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,030
You are in violation --

441
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,990
major violation of dress code 36-2903.

442
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,520
Noncompliance.

443
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,790
Get it together.

444
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,140
General?

445
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,290
Good God, man!

446
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,860
You sneak up on a man like that, that's not right.

447
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,380
That's not right.

448
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,930
Carl?

449
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,980
What the hell are you doing here?

450
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,370
Coulson, what the hell is Carl doing here?

451
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,050
He can explain it to you later.

452
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,950
- Are you okay to travel? - ‭Oh, no, I'm not in the best shape.

453
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,800
If your robot hadn't have shot him in the head.

454
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,260
If you still want to buy Hale's story about that, too, fine.

455
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,290
But can we agree this man needs to get out of here?

456
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,500
Listen to him, son.

457
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
He's an ally.

458
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,570
I'd like to get back and see my wife and child.

459
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,550
We good?

460
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,470
Yeah, let's get going.

461
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,740
Okay, Glenn, come on.

462
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,460
Perfect. Let's go.

463
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,160
- Come on. - Hey, you quit it! Quit being so handsy!

464
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,390
Glenn, I know we're under a bit of strain here,

465
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,610
but I'm gonna need you to use your inside voice.

466
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,740
- This is my inside voice! - ‭Okay.

467
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,390
Then your softer inside voice.

468
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,110
Elena, you know I don't like surprises.

469
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,910
Where you taking me?

470
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,960
If I can't convince you, someone else will.

471
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,930
What the hell is this?

472
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,110
An experiment.

473
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,090
The test of a hypothesis.

474
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,320
If that hypothesis is true,

475
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,260
you'll see ‭that you should let Fitz out.

476
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,240
I already ‭gave you my answer on that.

477
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,750
Yeah, but we want you to reconsider with all the facts,

478
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,490
so I'm going to prove that I can't be killed.

479
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,840
What, you, too, Simmons?

480
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,300
Do you know how all this sounds?

481
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,400
Like science.

482
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,980
No, sounds like ‭you're detached from reality.

483
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,490
Don't look at me. ‭I don't know what she's doing.

484
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,460
Well, what's an experiment without a little skepticism?

485
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,010
So, each of these beakers contain a liquid.

486
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,420
Three of them contain water,

487
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,810
the fourth holds ‭a phosphoric-acid compound

488
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,730
used in the hydraulics of Yo-Yo's arms --

489
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,610
highly toxic.

490
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,890
One sip will make you sick.

491
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,970
I mean, this much will surely kill you.

492
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,880
What the hell? Jemma...

493
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,710
- No. - Yes, Fitz.

494
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,550
I wouldn't be doing this if the science wasn't sound.

495
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,320
So, without knowing which is which,

496
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,940
I will drink three of them, and since I can't be killed,

497
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,050
I will happen to consume the three that just hold water.

498
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,830
This is insane.

499
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,620
No looking.

500
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm not looking.

501
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,750
Are you kidding -- Simmons.

502
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,850
Are you serious?

503
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,660
Ready.

504
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,650
Don't do it.

505
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,160
- He's right. Jemma, J-- - Don't. Don't.

506
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,390
Simmons -- Simmons, ‭I need you to stop right now!

507
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
No-- Oh, geez.

508
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,190
I will now drink the last one.

509
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,130
And it will be water.

510
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,760
- No. - No.

511
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,330
You would shoot me ‭just to keep me from dying?

512
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,390
No, I-I'll wound you to stop this madness.

513
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,190
No.

514
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,380
I don't think you will.

515
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,500
Simmons, please.

516
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,780
Please, Simmons, please don't.

517
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,040
- Jemma - ‭Stop!

518
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,260
Fitz.

519
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,340
Jemma?

520
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
‭Jemma!

521
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,760
Jemma!

522
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,530
Simmons! Fitz! Fitz, what do I do?!

523
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,300
She needs some alkaloid phosphate

524
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,600
to counteract the toxicity!

525
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,810
- Where do I find that?! - I know where it is! Let me out!

526
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,690
Let him out!

527
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,280
- Please. - Let him out!

528
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,870
Hang on, Jemma!

529
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,900
Hurry up!

530
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,960
Elena, open the door!

531
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,970
Now! Open the door!

532
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,260
Open the door now! Ele--

533
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,870
A heads-up would've been nice.

534
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,320
You sca--

535
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,300
Here.

536
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,250
Compliments on the performance, Dame Judi Dench.

537
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,270
That's the longest ‭you ever kept a lie going.

538
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,300
It wasn't all a lie, Fitz.

539
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,500
I might've chosen that one.

540
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,240
I didn't.

541
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,290
Because we are invincible.

542
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,190
And crazy...apparently.

543
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,440
Let me out of here.

544
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,320
I'm sorry, Mack.

545
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,430
I know you don't understand.

546
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,220
But I'm doing this to keep you safe.

547
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,290
You're right.

548
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
I don't understand.

549
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,310
If, for some reason, I don't come back, it means --

550
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,920
We've broken the time loop.

551
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,060
You know my feelings on that -- it can't be broken.

552
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,620
Is that ‭what you'd tell our daughter,

553
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,140
that her world can't be changed?

554
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,530
Maybe, don't know. Haven't met her yet...

555
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,100
Oh, for goodness sake.

556
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,190
- ...so maybe when I clear up - ‭Guys, guys!

557
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,060
You argue on the way.

558
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,030
But if you really believe that, Fitz,

559
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,950
then it means we're in no danger --

560
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,530
Lo siento.

561
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,090
Lo siento, lo siento.

562
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm just getting...

563
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,290
used to my fingers.

564
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,090
I'll get that.

565
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,870
That was close.

566
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,920
Let's go.

567
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,990
I'm glad you're here.

568
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,530
Me, too.

569
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,140
Robin...

570
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,820
Is this why you had stopped drawing before?

571
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,320
Because of what it shows?

572
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,240
We are going to try to make sure

573
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,680
that this future never happens, okay?

574
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,870
And to do that, we have to find --

575
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,520
Phillip J. Coulson.

576
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,310
He can put all the pieces together.

577
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,010
Yes.

578
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,460
But he's lost, and...

579
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm lost without him.

580
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,580
Daisy, too.

581
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,580
That's why you need each other so much.

582
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,720
Yeah.

583
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,790
He's gonna die.

584
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,770
You can see that?

585
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,190
We can save him.

586
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,500
Well, once again, my life depends on

587
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,220
a crayon drawing ‭of a crazy person, which is...

588
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,540
great for me.

589
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,400
Is May still with her?

590
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,420
Yeah.

591
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,270
I just cannot imagine bouncing back and forth

592
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,630
between the past and the future like that.

593
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,200
It sounds terrible.

594
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,190
God, finally, someone gets it.

595
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,930
Thank you for saying that,

596
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,610
'cause it's been like a pretzel up here

597
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,440
ever since I met up with you time travelers.

598
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,010
Yeah, I was talking about...

599
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,290
Robin.

600
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm sorry about your...

601
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,560
brain.

602
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,840
Coulson.

603
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,720
Yeah, she's seen him.

604
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,380
Okay, let's start searching for landmarks that might match.

605
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,370
It won't be easy.

606
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,890
But that might be where he is.

607
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,840
- I was brought in this way. - From where?

608
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,970
Any idea ‭where this bunker's located?

609
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,850
Well, I don't know.

610
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,040
I was kept in the dark, just like you, when I was brought in.

611
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,430
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

612
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,620
Are you okay?

613
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,270
Can you hear them arguing?

614
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,280
No. What do you hear?

615
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,500
It's nothing. Let's keep moving.

616
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,120
What's wrong with him, anyway?

617
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,390
I'm not the only one with a cooked noodle.

618
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,940
Keep your hands off me.

619
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,110
You need to eat.

620
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,940
There'll be time to eat after I've reconstructed this.

621
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,450
What's that?

622
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,330
Ruby?

623
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,260
Creel has broken out Talbot and Coulson.

624
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,840
They're trying to escape. Gear up and stop them.

625
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,280
We need Creel alive.

626
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,500
You, secure Strucker.

627
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,240
The rest of you, go with her.

628
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,680
Ruby...

629
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,320
...alive.

630
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,260
I heard you.

631
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,800
So, where are we going?

632
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,480
We have coordinates to three locations,

633
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,940
so we'll start with the closest

634
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,650
and hope we don't find company when we get there.

635
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,190
Wait. What about our pilot?

636
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,620
We have an auto-pilot, which I designed.

637
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,260
What's the worst that could happen?

638
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,950
They'll be on us in seconds.

639
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,260
Stay behind me.

640
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,720
Fallen hero.

641
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,210
Fallen hero.

642
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,610
He took a shot right to the ticker.

643
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,420
I've got no pulse.

644
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,420
Oh, my God. Do something, son.

645
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,020
Do something!

646
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,880
They never agree on anything.

647
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,930
You're feeling it now!

648
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,460
They agree -- I shouldn't help him.

649
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,510
They? Who's "They"?

650
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,720
We got a man down. Come on, soldier!

651
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,030
Do something!

652
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,300
You know, you die more than anybody I've ever met.

653
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,640
Who do I have to thank?

654
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,270
Thanks, Carl.

655
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,600
It's time to go.

656
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,450
This way. This way.

657
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,610
If you're thinking of blond jokes, now's not the time.

658
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,450
- I got a bunch of 'em. - ‭Go! Go!

659
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,770
Fire.

660
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,300
I wish we had time to take you both back into hiding,

661
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,070
but we'll keep you safe here.

662
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,130
I'm just glad that Robin was able to help you.

663
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,080
Me, too.

664
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,880
We think she might've given us a location.

665
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
We'll see what we can find.

666
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,290
Can I ask you something?

667
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,740
I don't understand everything that's happened here today,

668
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,900
but Robin clearly has a connection with you.

669
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,190
I, uh...

670
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,110
don't know if I can explain it.

671
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,610
I don't fully understand it myself.

672
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,980
You don't have to.

673
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,550
I've seen the drawings.

674
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,890
I know that I'm not in them.

675
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,870
- If anything happens to me - ‭Listen...

676
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,130
That's not gonna happen.

677
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,210
Okay?

678
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,830
Come sit next to me, Mommy.

679
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,790
I don't know how to get us out.

680
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,470
She's blocking the only exit I know.

681
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,180
I guess this is how it's gonna end.

682
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,800
Pinned down like Butch and Sundance.

683
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,190
Maybe that's a cliff we can jump off.

684
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,880
Carl, can you open this door, too?

685
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,970
Yeah.

686
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,050
I've got something for you to absorb.

687
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,980
I'll hold her off.

688
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,870
Come on.

689
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,820
Kill those two.

690
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,870
This one's mine.

691
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,230
Oh, no, no!

692
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,940
I'm not interested in going to outer space.

693
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm not a damn cosmonaut.

694
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,760
I think as long ‭as we avoid the altitude dial,

695
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,100
we should end up somewhere on Earth.

696
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,470
You know the Earth's 70% water, right?

697
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,760
I think we need to try this.

698
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,390
- Glenn. - ‭Yeah, okay.

699
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,450
Oh, boy. Here we go.

700
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,780
Stop!

701
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,250
Ruby.

702
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,620
Who the hell do you think you are?

703
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,010
I'm the Destroyer of Worlds.

704
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
Then go get them.

705
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,830
We're on Earth, right?

706
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,110
We can breathe.

707
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,760
I think it's good old Earth.

708
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,370
Well, we're in the middle of godforsaken nowhere.

709
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,670
We should get moving.

710
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,090
Hope hypothermia doesn't set in.

711
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,860
Maybe next time, ‭send us someplace warm, huh?

712
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,510
White sandy beaches and the palm trees.

713
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,270
That's not really my thing anymore.

714
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,870
We'll return in a moment.

715
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,060
How you got through to Garrett,

716
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,380
I'll never know, but thank you.

717
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,360
He learned to trust me, in the end.

718
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,990
And this is what I wanted.

719
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,270
Yes, but why did you care what I wanted?

720
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,310
I mean, to give me this.

721
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,610
This act cements a bond.

722
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,650
Yeah.

723
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,510
It does.

724
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,610
You have my undying loyalty now.

725
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,060
I never wanted ‭any of that Hydra nonsense.

726
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,810
I just wanted the Gravitonium.

727
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,610
Oh, no.

728
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,790
You misunderstand.

729
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,940
It wanted you.

730
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,440
No!
